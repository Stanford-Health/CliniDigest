The Fitbit Charge, a widely recognized wearable technology, plays a pivotal role in somnology trials by providing accurate, real-time data on sleep patterns, duration, and quality. This device is instrumental in trials focusing on the interplay between sleep and various health outcomes, such as the improvement of insomnia and its correlation with alcohol use outcomes [1]. In pediatric settings, the Fitbit Charge can be integrated into mobile health platforms to monitor and promote longer sleep durations, which are crucial for preventing childhood obesity [2]. Its utility extends to optimizing treatment adherence in conditions like obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), where consistent use of Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP) devices is essential for effective management [3]. Moreover, in studies assessing interventions like Bright Light Therapy (BLT) for improving sleep quality and cognitive function in older adults, the Fitbit Charge offers a non-intrusive method for monitoring sleep parameters and circadian rhythms [4]. Its relevance is not limited to pharmacological or device interventions; it also extends to evaluating the impact of anesthetic agents like desflurane on postoperative sleep quality [5], as well as the efficacy of natural supplements [6] and neurostimulation devices [7] on sleep quality and insomnia. Thus, the Fitbit Charge serves as a critical tool in somnology trials, enabling researchers to gather comprehensive sleep data that is essential for understanding the effectiveness of various interventions on sleep-related outcomes.
