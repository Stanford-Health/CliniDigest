The iPhone, as demonstrated through various cardiology trials, serves a multifaceted purpose in enhancing cardiac care, monitoring, and research. Its integration into cardiology trials underscores its utility in remote patient monitoring, facilitating the collection of high-quality, real-time data, and improving patient engagement and compliance with treatment protocols. In the DEFINE AFib study, the iPhone is used alongside Medtronic devices to collect and monitor patient data, showcasing its role in observational research and patient management [4]. Similarly, its application in the evaluation of ECG transmission and AI models using Apple Watch ECGs emphasizes the iPhone's capability in transmitting crucial cardiac health data for care guidance [5]. The validation of an iPhone-based event recorder for arrhythmia detection further highlights its diagnostic accuracy and patient compliance benefits, offering a non-inferior alternative to traditional event monitors [12]. Moreover, the iPhone's role in the Apple Heart & Movement Study illustrates its potential in large-scale research to identify early warning signs of cardiac and mobility deterioration, aiming to inform future interventions [36]. Collectively, these trials illustrate the iPhone's pivotal role in cardiology research and patient care, leveraging its technological capabilities to advance cardiac health monitoring, data collection, and patient engagement in clinical settings.
