The Polar H, a chest-worn Holter monitor, plays a pivotal role in psychiatry trials by providing accurate, real-time heart rate variability (HRV) data, which is crucial for assessing autonomic nervous system function and its correlation with psychiatric conditions. In the context of these trials, the Polar H serves multiple purposes: it acts as a non-invasive tool for monitoring physiological responses to psychiatric interventions, aids in the evaluation of treatment efficacy, and facilitates the understanding of the biobehavioral mechanisms underlying various psychiatric disorders and their treatments. For instance, in a study targeting binge-spectrum eating disorders, the Polar H is used to capture HRV data, offering insights into participants' autonomic regulation before and after an interoceptive exposure intervention, thereby assessing the intervention's impact on physiological stress responses [7]. Similarly, in a study focused on unpaid primary caregivers of persons with Alzheimer's Disease, the Polar H is employed to collect HRV data as a biomarker of stress regulation, aiming to evaluate the effectiveness of a cognitive emotion regulation intervention [13]. These examples underscore the Polar H's utility in psychiatric research, highlighting its role in advancing our understanding of the physiological aspects of psychiatric conditions and the potential for developing more targeted and effective interventions.
