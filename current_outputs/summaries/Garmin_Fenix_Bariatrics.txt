The Garmin Fenix, a sophisticated multisport GPS watch, serves a pivotal role in bariatrics trials by facilitating the monitoring and enhancement of physical activity and rehabilitation in obese patients undergoing various treatments. In the context of telerehabilitation, the Garmin Fenix can be instrumental in tracking the physical intensity of patients' activities at home, thereby contributing to the primary goal of observing the impact of telerehabilitation modalities on physical activity levels post-hospitalization [1]. Furthermore, its advanced features, such as detailed activity tracking, heart rate monitoring, and sleep analysis, align with the objectives of digital interventions aimed at promoting physical activity among obese individuals. By leveraging gamification and teamwork, the Garmin Fenix can motivate patients to engage in physical activities, helping to overcome barriers associated with weight stigma [2]. Additionally, in trials focusing on the effects of protein supplementation and structured exercise programs post-bariatric surgery, the Garmin Fenix's capabilities to monitor exercise intensity and adherence could be invaluable in assessing the program's impact on muscle mass and overall physical condition [6]. Thus, the Garmin Fenix emerges as a critical tool in bariatrics trials, offering comprehensive data collection and analysis capabilities that support the multifaceted approach needed to address obesity and its comorbidities effectively.
