The Garmin Fenix, a sophisticated wearable technology, is increasingly being integrated into oncology trials to enhance patient monitoring, improve quality of life (QoL), and facilitate personalized interventions. Its purpose in these trials is multifaceted, primarily focusing on the collection of real-world data (RWD) to monitor physical activity, sleep quality, and heart rate, which are critical parameters in assessing the overall health and well-being of cancer patients [2][3]. For instance, in the REBECCA-2 study, the Garmin Fenix is utilized to gather RWD, enabling personalized follow-up care aimed at improving the QoL of breast cancer survivors by detecting signs of QoL deterioration and facilitating timely interventions [2]. Similarly, the eCAN JA project employs this device to automatically collect physical parameters, supporting tele-rehabilitation and tele-psychological support programs that aim to empower patients and improve their QoL through enhanced remote monitoring [3]. Moreover, the device's role extends to pediatric oncology, where it aids in measuring recovery post-surgery through smartwatch data and questionnaires, highlighting its versatility across different age groups and cancer types [7]. The Garmin Fenix's ability to seamlessly integrate into patients' lives while providing valuable health metrics positions it as a pivotal tool in modern oncology trials, driving forward the paradigm of personalized and remote patient care.
