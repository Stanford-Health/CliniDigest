The purpose of a Withings Sleep in chronic pain or disease trials is to leverage its advanced sleep tracking capabilities to enhance the understanding and management of chronic conditions. By integrating Withings Sleep data, researchers can obtain detailed insights into sleep patterns and quality, which are crucial for evaluating the impact of treatments and disease progression in conditions like Multiple Sclerosis [1,3] and chronic migraine [2]. Furthermore, in trials such as those assessing the effectiveness of IVIG treatment in CIDP patients [4], Withings Sleep can provide valuable, continuous, and non-intrusive monitoring of sleep disturbances that may correlate with disease activity, thereby offering a comprehensive view of patient health and treatment efficacy.
