The Polar Verity Sense is instrumental in cardiology trials, such as "The Heart of the Community Study," for its advanced capability to monitor heart rate variability (HRV) and other physiological parameters in real-time [1]. Its use is pivotal in assessing the impact of relational savoring (RS) interventions on cardiometabolic (CM) risk factors among community service providers (CSPs), specifically in measuring outcomes related to HRV during stress and at rest [1]. This technology supports the trial's aim to enhance CM health behaviors and outcomes, thereby facilitating a comprehensive evaluation of RS's effectiveness in reducing CM risk within high-stress, frontline job roles [1].
