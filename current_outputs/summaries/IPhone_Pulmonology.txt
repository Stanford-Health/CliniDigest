The integration of iPhones and mobile applications into pulmonology trials signifies a transformative approach towards enhancing patient management, monitoring, and treatment adherence in respiratory conditions. These trials leverage the ubiquity and advanced capabilities of iPhones to facilitate remote health monitoring, personalized patient care, and improved clinical outcomes. For instance, the use of a smartphone-based switch program [4] and a self-management app [10] in asthma care underscores the potential of mobile devices to support asthma patients in monitoring their condition and managing their treatment more effectively. Similarly, the deployment of a smartphone application for asthma self-management [17] highlights the feasibility and acceptability of such interventions among adolescents, indicating a promising avenue for engaging younger populations in their health management. The accuracy of smartphone pulse oximetry [11] further exemplifies the potential of iPhones in providing reliable health metrics outside traditional clinical settings, thereby extending the scope of patient monitoring to more convenient and accessible platforms. Moreover, the application of iPhones in the dispersed clinical validation of cough monitoring systems [5] and in the evaluation of a new 6-minute walk test app [26] demonstrates their versatility in assessing a range of pulmonary functions. Collectively, these trials [4,5,10,11,17,26] illustrate the critical role of iPhones in advancing pulmonology research and practice by offering innovative solutions for patient engagement, treatment adherence, and remote monitoring, ultimately aiming to improve the quality of life for individuals with respiratory conditions.
