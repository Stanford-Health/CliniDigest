The Oura Ring, a smart wearable device, has emerged as a significant tool in the realm of general physiology trials, demonstrating its versatility and utility across various research domains. Primarily, the Oura Ring is employed to monitor and analyze physiological and behavioral responses to interventions, thereby offering insights into the effectiveness of therapeutic modalities and lifestyle adjustments on health outcomes. In the context of physiotherapeutic interventions following total knee replacement surgery, the Oura Ring facilitates remote monitoring of patient recovery, enabling timely adjustments to care plans based on activity and sleep data [3]. This capability underscores the ring's potential to enhance post-operative outcomes and patient satisfaction by providing a personalized recovery experience. Furthermore, the device's application in evaluating the impact of work schedule changes on nurse managers' wellbeing illustrates its utility in occupational health research. By collecting data on physical activity, sleep, and heart rate variability, the Oura Ring offers a comprehensive overview of the physiological effects of work patterns, contributing to the development of strategies aimed at reducing burnout and improving job performance [5]. Collectively, these trials highlight the Oura Ring's role in advancing our understanding of human physiology in response to various interventions, marking it as a valuable asset in the toolkit of clinical research coordinators and investigators aiming to optimize health outcomes and performance in diverse populations.
