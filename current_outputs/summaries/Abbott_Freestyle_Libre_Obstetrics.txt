The Abbott Freestyle Libre, a continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) device, is being explored in obstetrics trials to enhance the management and outcomes of gestational diabetes (GDM) by providing real-time glucose data. Its purpose spans from potentially improving diagnostic accuracy and treatment personalization [2], to evaluating its impact on pregnancy outcomes in women with a history of gastric bypass surgery [3], and comparing its efficacy against standard blood glucose monitoring in managing GDM, including early onset cases, to improve maternal and fetal health [4]. These trials underscore the device's potential to revolutionize GDM care by offering a more nuanced understanding of glucose patterns and treatment effectiveness.
