The Abbott Freestyle Libre system plays a pivotal role in endocrinology trials by providing a non-invasive, continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) solution that enhances the management and understanding of diabetes across various populations and conditions. Its application ranges from evaluating its effectiveness in improving glycemic control in Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) patients [2], to assessing its impact on lifestyle interventions and dietary modifications in managing diabetes and prediabetes [23, 32]. Furthermore, the device is instrumental in exploring the metabolic responses to different dietary compositions [111] and understanding the glycemic variability in specific conditions such as gestational diabetes [12, 57]. The Freestyle Libre system's ability to offer real-time glucose data without the need for fingerstick calibration makes it an invaluable tool in trials aiming to reduce the burden of diabetes self-management [38, 116] and improve patient outcomes by facilitating more informed and timely therapeutic decisions [7, 84]. By enabling detailed monitoring of glucose patterns, the device supports personalized diabetes management strategies [109], potentially leading to better adherence to treatment plans and improved quality of life for individuals with diabetes [113]. Its use in research settings underscores the shift towards more patient-centered, technology-driven approaches in endocrinology, aiming to optimize diabetes care and reduce the risk of complications associated with poor glycemic control [115, 119].
