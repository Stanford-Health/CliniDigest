The utilization of iPhones in chronic pain or disease trials represents a transformative approach towards enhancing patient engagement, monitoring, and intervention delivery in clinical research. These devices serve as pivotal tools for real-time health data collection, facilitating remote patient monitoring and personalized care. For instance, the Scripps Wired for Health Monitoring Study [1] leverages iPhones for tracking health measurements in patients with chronic diseases, underscoring the device's capability in improving disease management through self-monitoring. Similarly, the implementation of digital health technologies, including iPhones, in the Stanford Spine Keeper trial [3] and the Geisinger Health System study [5] further exemplifies the iPhone's role in delivering multidisciplinary interventions and collecting self-reported data on clinical outcomes, respectively. These trials collectively highlight the iPhone's potential in reducing healthcare visits and costs by enabling home-based monitoring and interventions. Moreover, the integration of iPhones in the management of rheumatoid arthritis flares [12] and the monitoring of physical activity in patients with multiple sclerosis [59] showcases the device's versatility in supporting diverse clinical research areas. Through these applications, iPhones emerge as essential instruments in chronic pain and disease trials, offering a promising avenue for advancing patient-centered research and care.
