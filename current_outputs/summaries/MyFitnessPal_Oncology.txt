The utilization of MyFitnessPal in oncology trials, as evidenced in the EDEN study [1], underscores its pivotal role in facilitating dietary and exercise interventions aimed at improving patient outcomes. By enabling participants to meticulously record their dietary intake, MyFitnessPal serves as a critical tool in assessing the impact of nutritional and physical activity modifications on the gut microbiome of melanoma patients undergoing immunotherapy [1]. This digital platform's integration into the trial's methodology exemplifies the broader trend of leveraging technology to enhance the precision and efficacy of oncological research. Through such applications, researchers can gather detailed, real-time data on patient adherence to prescribed lifestyle changes, thereby enriching the quality of evidence on how diet and exercise can influence cancer treatment and potentially the disease trajectory itself.
