The purpose of an iPhone in gastroenterology trials is multifaceted, primarily focusing on enhancing patient adherence to medication, monitoring symptoms, and improving clinical outcomes through innovative digital health solutions. Trials such as the HCV Tappt Adherence Study [3] and the study on the efficacy and adherence to subcutaneous vs. intravenous Vedolizumab in patients with Inflammatory Bowel Disease using a novel remote monitoring intervention [6] underscore the iPhone's role in facilitating remote monitoring and management of treatment adherence and symptom tracking. These trials leverage the iPhone's capabilities to support digital health applications that enable patients to record medication adherence and symptom progression in real-time, offering clinicians a more dynamic and accurate picture of patient health and treatment efficacy. Furthermore, the CirrhoCare trial [8] illustrates the iPhone's potential in enhancing care and access to treatment for patients with cirrhosis through digital home monitoring and management, highlighting its significance in reducing healthcare utilization and improving the quality of life for patients with gastroenterological conditions. Collectively, these trials demonstrate the iPhone's critical role in advancing gastroenterology research and patient care by integrating digital health technologies into clinical practice.
