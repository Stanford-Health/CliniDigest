The Abbott Freestyle Libre, a continuous glucose monitoring system, plays a crucial role in general physiology trials by providing real-time, comprehensive insights into the glycemic responses of participants under various conditions. In trials examining the effects of dietary choices on cognitive performance and mood in children [1], the device can offer valuable data on how different foods influence blood glucose levels, potentially correlating these fluctuations with cognitive outcomes. Similarly, in studies assessing physiological reactions to food intake [2] and the impact of thermal environments on appetite and energy intake [3], the Freestyle Libre allows for the continuous monitoring of interstitial glucose levels. This capability is essential for understanding the complex interplay between diet, environmental factors, and glucose metabolism, thereby contributing to a more nuanced understanding of human physiology.
