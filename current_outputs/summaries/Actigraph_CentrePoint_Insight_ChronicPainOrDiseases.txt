The Actigraph CentrePoint Insight plays a crucial role in chronic pain or disease trials by providing objective, high-resolution data on physical activity and sleep patterns, which are essential for evaluating the effectiveness of interventions like the Computerized Chemosensory-Based Orbitofrontal Networks Training for Treatment of Pain (CBOT-P) [1]. By accurately measuring changes in patient mobility and rest, the device can offer invaluable insights into the impact of CBOT-P on functional outcomes, supporting the trial's aim to assess improvements in pain severity, negative affect, and cognitive impairments [1]. This technology thus facilitates a deeper understanding of the relationship between physical activity, sleep quality, and chronic pain management, enabling researchers to refine therapeutic approaches for enhanced patient care [1].
