The Withings ScanWatch, a sophisticated wearable vital signs monitor, holds significant promise in oncology trials by enhancing patient monitoring and care. Its purpose in such trials is multifaceted: firstly, to assess the feasibility and acceptability of continuous vital signs monitoring during cancer treatment [1]. This is crucial in understanding patient tolerance and the practicality of integrating such technology into routine care. Secondly, the Withings ScanWatch can contribute to the collection of biometric data alongside patient-reported outcomes, offering a comprehensive view of the patient's health status in real-time [2]. This dual approach of capturing both subjective patient experiences and objective physiological data can provide clinicians with invaluable insights, potentially leading to more personalized and responsive cancer treatment strategies. Therefore, the Withings ScanWatch serves as a pivotal tool in the pursuit of optimizing patient care and treatment efficacy in oncology trials.
