The Garmin Fenix, in the context of gynecology trials, serves as a pivotal tool for monitoring and analyzing the physiological impacts of training load in relation to menstrual cycle phases among female athletes [1]. By leveraging its advanced tracking capabilities, the device facilitates the collection of longitudinal data on performance, anthropometric measures, and other critical indicators affected by hormonal fluctuations [1]. This enables researchers to identify correlations between training intensity, menstrual cycle phases, and their combined effects on athletes' health and performance, thereby contributing to the development of tailored training programs that account for the unique physiological considerations of female athletes [1].
