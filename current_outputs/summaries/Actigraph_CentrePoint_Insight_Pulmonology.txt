The Actigraph CentrePoint Insight plays a pivotal role in pulmonology trials, particularly in the context of fibrotic lung diseases, by providing objective, accelerometer-measured physical activity (PA) parameters. In the trial titled "Physical Activity and Quality of Life in Fibrotic Lung Diseases After Initiating Anti-fibrotic Therapy and Pulmonary Rehabilitation" [1], the device is utilized to assess the impact of anti-fibrotic therapy and pulmonary rehabilitation on patients' physical activity levels and quality of life. The Actigraph CentrePoint Insight's ability to measure total daily steps and moderate-vigorous physical activity offers a novel approach to monitor disease progression and therapeutic outcomes in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) and pulmonary fibrosis interstitial lung disease (PF-ILD) patients [1]. Furthermore, the correlation of actigraphic PA indices with clinical outcomes, such as the six-minute walk distance, GAP score, and pulmonary function tests, underscores its potential in guiding patient-centric care and informing future research directions in pulmonology [1].
