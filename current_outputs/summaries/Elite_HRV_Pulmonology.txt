The purpose of employing Elite HRV in pulmonology trials, as exemplified by the study on "Breathing Exercises and Auricular Vagus Nerve Stimulation" [1], is to provide a comprehensive assessment of autonomic nervous system function through non-invasive means. By measuring heart rate variability (HRV) metrics such as RMSSD, PNN50, LF/HF, LF Power, and HF Power [1], researchers can infer the balance between the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems. This is crucial in pulmonology trials, especially when evaluating interventions like breathing exercises and vagus nerve stimulation, which are believed to influence cardiovascular and respiratory health through autonomic pathways [1]. The Elite HRV tool, therefore, serves as a critical instrument in quantifying the physiological effects of such interventions on pulmonary function and autonomic regulation, offering insights into their efficacy and mechanisms of action in a non-intrusive manner [1].
