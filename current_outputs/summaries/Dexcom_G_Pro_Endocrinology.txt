The Dexcom G Pro serves as a pivotal tool in advancing the management and understanding of diabetes within endocrinology trials. Its primary purpose is to provide continuous, real-time monitoring of glucose levels, offering a comprehensive overview of a patient's glycemic profile. This capability is crucial for evaluating the efficacy and safety of various diabetes management strategies and interventions across diverse patient populations, including those with type 1 and type 2 diabetes, as well as specific subgroups such as children, adolescents, and adults [13, 19, 20, 31, 32]. By enabling detailed tracking of glucose fluctuations in response to factors like diet, physical activity, and medication, the Dexcom G Pro facilitates the development of personalized treatment plans aimed at optimizing glycemic control [6, 24, 25]. Furthermore, its use in trials investigating the impact of lifestyle interventions [27, 34, 36] and advanced technologies like artificial pancreas systems [17, 21, 22] underscores its versatility and critical role in pushing the boundaries of diabetes care. The Dexcom G Pro's ability to detect and alert patients and clinicians to episodes of hyperglycemia and hypoglycemia in real-time also supports its utility in enhancing patient safety and improving clinical outcomes in endocrinology trials [13, 18, 23].
