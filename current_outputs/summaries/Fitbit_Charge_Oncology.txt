The utilization of Fitbit Charge devices in oncology trials underscores a multifaceted approach to enhancing patient care and research methodologies within the field. Primarily, these devices serve to objectively monitor physical activity and sleep patterns in cancer patients, offering a non-invasive means to gather data that can inform both clinical and supportive care strategies. For instance, in a pilot trial involving participants with head and neck cancer undergoing radiation therapy, the Fitbit Charge 3 is employed to investigate daily step and sleep data, with the aim of detecting early signs of treatment or disease-related symptoms, potentially improving quality of life and reducing hospital visits [8]. Similarly, the device is used in studies assessing sleep disturbances and circadian rhythms in patients with primary brain tumors, providing valuable insights into how tumors may impact sleep, which could lead to improved treatment and supportive care studies [13]. Moreover, the Fitbit Charge is instrumental in interventions designed to increase physical activity among cancer survivors, as seen in trials where it is provided to participants to encourage and monitor their engagement in exercise programs [12]. These examples illustrate the critical role of Fitbit Charge devices in oncology trials, where they contribute to a deeper understanding of patient experiences and facilitate the development of tailored interventions aimed at enhancing the overall well-being of individuals with cancer.
