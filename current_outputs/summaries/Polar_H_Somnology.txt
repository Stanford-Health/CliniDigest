The Polar H, specifically the Polar H10 device, is utilized in somnology trials to provide accurate and comprehensive data on heart rate variability (HRV) and other cardiovascular parameters, which are crucial for understanding the impact of various treatments on sleep quality and related health outcomes. In the context of somnology, the purpose of employing the Polar H device is multifaceted. Primarily, it serves as a non-invasive tool to monitor autonomic nervous system activity, offering insights into the physiological responses associated with sleep disturbances and interventions [4]. For instance, in a study examining the effects of vitamin D and SGLT-2 inhibitor treatment in CPAP-naive obstructive sleep apnea patients, the Polar H10 device was used to assess heart rate variability, alongside other measurements, to evaluate the intervention's impact on cardiovascular risks and sleepiness symptoms [3]. This application underscores the device's role in linking cardiovascular health with sleep quality, providing a holistic view of treatment efficacy. By enabling precise and continuous monitoring of HRV, the Polar H device facilitates a deeper understanding of the autonomic nervous system's role in sleep regulation and the potential cardiovascular benefits of somnology interventions. Its use in clinical trials reflects the growing recognition of the interconnectedness between sleep, cardiovascular health, and overall well-being, highlighting the importance of employing advanced technological tools in sleep research.
