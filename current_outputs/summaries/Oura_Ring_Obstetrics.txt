The Oura Ring, a sophisticated wearable technology, is increasingly being integrated into obstetrics trials to enhance maternal health monitoring and support. Its purpose spans from collecting multi-dimensional data to understand maternal physiology and pathology [1], aiding in weight-management interventions for obese pregnant mothers by monitoring vital health metrics [2], to assessing its applicability and acceptability in monitoring physical activity and sleep during pregnancy [3]. These trials collectively highlight the potential of the Oura Ring to provide continuous, real-time health data, which can empower pregnant women and healthcare providers with insights into health behaviors, physiological changes, and potential complications. By leveraging the Oura Ring's capabilities, researchers aim to develop targeted interventions, improve maternal health outcomes, and foster a deeper understanding of pregnancy dynamics through the lens of wearable technology [1,2,3].
