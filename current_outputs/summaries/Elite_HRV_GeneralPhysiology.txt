The Elite HRV, a tool for measuring heart rate variability, serves a pivotal role in general physiology trials by providing insights into the autonomic nervous system's (ANS) response to various interventions. Its application ranges from evaluating the immediate effects of chiropractic manipulations on the ANS and balance [1], to assessing the impact of manual therapy on autonomic parameters influencing physical and sporting performance [2]. Furthermore, it is instrumental in comparing the efficacy of novel therapies aimed at regulating the ANS in conditions like functional dysphonia [3], and in exploring the physiological responses, including autonomic function, to non-invasive vagal nerve stimulation techniques [4]. Through these diverse applications, the Elite HRV emerges as a critical tool in understanding the complex interplay between therapeutic interventions and autonomic regulation, highlighting its versatility and importance in advancing clinical and physiological research.
