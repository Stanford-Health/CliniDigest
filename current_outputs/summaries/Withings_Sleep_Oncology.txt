The Withings Sleep, a sophisticated sleep tracking mat, offers a unique opportunity to enhance oncology trials by providing comprehensive sleep quality data, which is crucial for evaluating health-related quality of life in patients undergoing treatment. In the context of the trial on locally advanced pancreatic cancer after systemic therapy [1], incorporating Withings Sleep could enable researchers to quantitatively assess the impact of local ablative MR-guided radiotherapy (MRgRT) on sleep patterns and overall well-being. This integration could provide invaluable insights into how treatment modalities influence rest, a key component of patient recovery and quality of life, thereby enriching the trial's outcomes and supporting more holistic patient care approaches in oncology.
