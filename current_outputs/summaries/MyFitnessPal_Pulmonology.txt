The purpose of MyFitnessPal in pulmonology trials, particularly in the context of the described study [1], is to facilitate a comprehensive telehealth-delivered intervention aimed at improving the quality of life for patients with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) and Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA) through lifestyle modifications and exercise. By integrating MyFitnessPal into the intervention, the trial seeks to leverage its capabilities in tracking diet and physical activity, thereby supporting overweight and obese patients in achieving significant weight loss and enhancing their pulmonary rehabilitation outcomes. This approach underscores the potential of digital health tools in augmenting traditional pulmonary care and rehabilitation efforts, offering a scalable solution to manage and mitigate the impacts of pulmonary conditions [1].
