The integration of Apple Watch into oncology trials signifies a transformative approach towards personalized and remote patient monitoring, aiming to enhance the quality of cancer care and research. The purpose of incorporating Apple Watch in these trials is multifaceted, primarily focusing on monitoring physical activity, psychological well-being, and overall health status in real-time. For instance, in a study aimed at reducing morbidity and mortality among hematopoietic stem cell transplant patients, Apple Watches are used to track physical function and provide feedback on treatment-related experiences [1]. This indicates the device's role in collecting patient-generated health data, which is crucial for assessing treatment tolerance and patient outcomes.

Moreover, Apple Watches facilitate remote monitoring, allowing for continuous data collection without the need for frequent hospital visits. This is evident in trials assessing the impact of interventions on cancer-related fatigue and quality of life, where the device's sensors play a critical role in gathering health data remotely [9]. Additionally, in the context of chemoradiotherapy for lung cancer, the Apple Watch, alongside other digital tools, is employed to collect patient-generated health data, underscoring its utility in evaluating treatment effects and enhancing patient engagement in their care [10].

In summary, the Apple Watch's integration into oncology trials represents a strategic move towards leveraging digital health technologies to improve cancer care. By enabling real-time monitoring, personalized feedback, and remote data collection, the Apple Watch holds the potential to significantly contribute to the advancement of oncology research and patient outcomes [1,9,10].
