The Abbott Freestyle Libre, a continuous glucose monitoring system, plays a pivotal role in oncology trials, particularly in managing and understanding the complexities of hyperglycemia in colorectal cancer surgery [1]. Its primary purpose is to facilitate real-time, accurate monitoring of blood glucose levels, thereby assessing the feasibility of its use in a surgical oncology setting [1]. Furthermore, it aids in analyzing the impact of surgical stress and interventions on glucose levels, offering insights into perioperative glycemic fluctuations [1]. Importantly, it also serves to evaluate the potential predictive value of hyperglycemia for postoperative complications, such as surgical site infections [1]. This underscores its significance in enhancing postoperative care and outcomes in oncology patients.
