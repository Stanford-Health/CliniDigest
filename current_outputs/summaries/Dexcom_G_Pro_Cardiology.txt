The Dexcom G Pro serves a multifaceted purpose in cardiology trials, primarily aimed at enhancing glycemic control and monitoring in patients with cardiac conditions. Its application ranges from evaluating dietary impacts on glycemic variability in the context of heart health [1], to facilitating post-acute myocardial infarction glucose management in diabetic patients [2]. Additionally, it proves crucial in assessing glucose levels accuracy during and after cardiopulmonary bypass surgeries [3], and in comparing the effectiveness of continuous glucose monitoring against traditional glucose testing methods in cardiac surgery patients, potentially reducing surgery-related complications [4]. This underscores its pivotal role in advancing cardiac patient care through innovative glucose monitoring technologies.
