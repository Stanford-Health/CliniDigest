The utilization of smartphones, particularly iPhones, in obstetrics trials underscores a transformative approach towards enhancing prenatal and postnatal care through digital health interventions. These trials collectively demonstrate the multifaceted applications of smartphone technology in obstetrics, ranging from improving dietary and physical activity behaviors during pregnancy [4], to facilitating better breastfeeding practices [2][3], and even managing conditions such as gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) [7]. The purpose of integrating iPhones into these trials is manifold: to provide accessible, personalized health information and support [2][3], to enable real-time monitoring and feedback on health behaviors and physiological parameters [4][7], and to improve the understanding of pregnancy-related symptoms and complications through the collection and analysis of data from connected devices [5]. Moreover, the use of smartphone applications in trials like the one focused on mindful eating [1] and the evaluation of a smartphone-based tool for assessing neonatal jaundice [8] further exemplifies the potential of these devices to deliver innovative, patient-centered interventions. These applications not only aim to enhance the efficacy of health interventions but also strive to empower pregnant women by providing them with tools and resources to actively participate in their own care. Thus, iPhones in obstetrics trials represent a pivotal element in the evolution of prenatal and postnatal care, offering a promising avenue for improving maternal and neonatal health outcomes through technology-driven solutions.
