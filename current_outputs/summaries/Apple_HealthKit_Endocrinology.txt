The purpose of an Apple HealthKit in endocrinology trials, particularly in the management of Type 1 Diabetes (T1D) in pediatric patients, is to facilitate remote monitoring and data collection, enhancing patient care and outcomes. By integrating technologies like the GluVue platform for continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) data analysis [1], and adopting comprehensive management programs that emphasize teamwork, targets, technology, and tight control [2], Apple HealthKit can play a pivotal role. It supports the seamless aggregation and analysis of health data, enabling personalized and timely interventions by healthcare teams, thereby potentially improving the quality of life for patients with T1D.
