The Dexcom G Pro, a continuous glucose monitoring system, serves a pivotal role in general physiology trials by enabling real-time, comprehensive glucose monitoring crucial for assessing the impact of interventions on metabolic health. In trials like the feasibility study on physical rehabilitation of older persons following hospitalization due to infections [1], it could provide invaluable insights into how exercise interventions affect glucose regulation, a key aspect of recovery and overall health. Similarly, in studies focused on continuous wireless monitoring [2] and interventions aimed at reducing sedentary behavior [3], the Dexcom G Pro could offer critical data on how changes in physical activity and health monitoring practices influence glucose levels, thereby contributing to a deeper understanding of the physiological effects of these interventions.
