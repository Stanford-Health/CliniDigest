The Dreem Headband serves a pivotal role in gastroenterology trials, particularly in the context of Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (IBD), by providing an innovative method for monitoring sleep patterns and disorders. In the trial titled "Evaluation of Sleep Changes in Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (IBD) Patients" [1], the Dreem Headband is utilized alongside actigraphy and questionnaires to assess sleep disorders in patients during remission phases. This approach underscores the hypothesis that sleep disturbances may precede IBD flare-ups, aiming to establish sleep efficacy as a predictive marker for flare occurrences [1]. Therefore, the Dreem Headband's integration into the study design is instrumental in advancing our understanding of the interplay between sleep quality and IBD activity, potentially leading to improved predictive models for flare management in IBD patients [1].
