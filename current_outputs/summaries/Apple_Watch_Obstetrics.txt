The purpose of an Apple Watch in obstetrics trials, as evidenced by the initiatives to reduce maternal morbidity and mortality among pregnant refugee women [1] and the feasibility study of using NeoSpot in community settings [2], is multifaceted. Primarily, it serves as a digital health tracking tool aimed at improving the detection and monitoring of high blood pressure and other health-related issues during pregnancy [1]. This is crucial in environments where traditional monitoring systems are either unavailable or impractical, such as in low-and-middle-income countries (LMICs) and among refugee populations [1][2]. The Apple Watch, through its capabilities for at-home measurements and continuous vital sign monitoring, offers a low-cost, accessible solution that can be integrated into routine antenatal care visits to enhance the identification and treatment of pregnancy-related conditions, thereby potentially reducing the risks of preeclampsia and improving overall maternal health outcomes [1][2].
