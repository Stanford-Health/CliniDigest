The purpose of Google Fit in pulmonology trials, specifically within the context of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) rehabilitation, is to provide a comprehensive and accessible means of monitoring physical activity and sleep patterns in patients undergoing pulmonary rehabilitation [1]. By integrating Google Fit into the trial, researchers aim to objectively assess the impact of pulmonary rehabilitation on physical activity levels and sleep quality, which are critical components of overall health and well-being in COPD patients. This digital health tool enables the collection of real-time, continuous data, offering insights into the effectiveness of rehabilitation interventions and the potential for personalized patient management strategies [1].
