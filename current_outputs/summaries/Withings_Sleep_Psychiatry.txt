The Withings Sleep device represents a pivotal advancement in psychiatry trials, particularly in the context of understanding postpartum depression (PPD) and its associated factors [1]. By facilitating home-based, long-term sleep assessments, the Withings Sleep enables researchers to collect comprehensive sleep data from new mothers, offering insights into the intricate relationship between sleep quality, oxytocin levels, and reward processing [1]. This approach not only surpasses the limitations of traditional sleep studies reliant on questionnaires and short-term assessments but also provides a more nuanced understanding of how sleep disturbances might contribute to or exacerbate depressive symptoms and affect maternal caregiving abilities [1]. Consequently, the use of Withings Sleep in psychiatry trials holds significant promise for advancing our understanding of PPD and developing targeted interventions to support maternal mental health [1].
