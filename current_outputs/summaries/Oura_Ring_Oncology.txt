The Oura Ring, a wearable device designed for continuous health monitoring, is increasingly being recognized for its potential utility in oncology trials, particularly for its role in enhancing patient care and monitoring during cancer treatment. In the context of oncology, the Oura Ring's primary purpose appears to be centered around the feasibility of remote monitoring, the assessment of patient quality of life, and the correlation of biometric data with clinical outcomes. Specifically, the OURA Ring Wearable Testing in MDS Patients trial [5] aims to explore the feasibility of MDS patients wearing the Oura Ring to upload biometrics weekly, with a hypothesis that it will be feasible for patients to wear the device 70% of the time over three months. This trial underscores the potential of the Oura Ring to facilitate remote monitoring and data collection in a non-intrusive manner, which could significantly contribute to personalized patient care in oncology.

Moreover, the Enhanced Monitoring for Better Recovery and Cancer Experience in Greater Manchester (EMBRaCE-GM) study [7] further supports the utility of wearable vital signs monitors, like the Oura Ring, in cancer treatment. By evaluating the feasibility, acceptability, and insights gained from continuous vital signs monitoring, this study highlights the broader implications of wearable technology in improving patient experiences and outcomes during cancer treatment. Collectively, these trials [5,7] illustrate the evolving landscape of oncology care, where wearable technologies such as the Oura Ring play a pivotal role in remote patient monitoring, potentially leading to more tailored and responsive treatment strategies.
