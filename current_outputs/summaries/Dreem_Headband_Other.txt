The Dreem Headband, in clinical trials, is designed to serve as a non-invasive, innovative tool for monitoring and potentially improving sleep quality in patients with various conditions, including early Parkinson's Disease (PD) [1]. Given the significance of sleep disturbances in PD and their impact on both motor and non-motor symptoms, the Dreem Headband could be instrumental in trials like the one described for CVN424 [1], by providing critical data on sleep patterns and quality. This could help in understanding the broader effects of new treatments on sleep and overall well-being, thereby offering a more holistic view of patient health and the efficacy of interventions in early-stage PD [1].
