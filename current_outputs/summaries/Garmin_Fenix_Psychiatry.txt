The Garmin Fenix series, renowned for its advanced tracking capabilities, has emerged as a pivotal tool in psychiatry trials, serving multiple purposes ranging from monitoring physical activity to assessing stress and emotional responses. In the realm of psychiatry, where subjective self-reports have traditionally dominated, the objective data provided by wearable technology like the Garmin Fenix offers a new avenue for understanding the complex interplay between physical activity, stress, and mental health. For instance, in trials aimed at increasing physical activity through social support and stress resilience among older adults, the Garmin Fenix is utilized to monitor participants' physical activity, facilitating the examination of how technological enhancements can lead to greater physical activity and, by extension, improved psychosocial outcomes [1]. Similarly, in studies focusing on stress physiology among first responder parents, the device's ability to remotely monitor stress responses presents a novel method for correlating heart rate variability data with self-reported stress, thereby offering insights into the effectiveness of wearables in improving emotion regulation [2]. Furthermore, the Garmin Fenix's role extends to the exploration of correlations between physical health parameters and psychiatric conditions, such as in the assessment of stress levels in burn patients to understand the relationship between stress, PTSD, and scar pruritus [4]. Collectively, these trials underscore the Garmin Fenix's utility in psychiatry research as a means to bridge the gap between subjective experiences and objective physiological data, offering a more nuanced understanding of mental health conditions and their management.
