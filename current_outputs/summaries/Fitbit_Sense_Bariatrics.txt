The Fitbit Sense, a sophisticated wearable technology, plays a pivotal role in bariatrics trials by facilitating the monitoring and enhancement of physical activity and sleep patterns among participants. In the "Fit 24 Technology Intervention YOUTH" trial [1], the device is employed as a central component of a goal-setting intervention aimed at Hispanic adolescents with obesity. This trial underscores the utility of the Fitbit Sense in collecting real-time, objective data on physical activity levels and sleep quality, which are critical factors in the management and treatment of obesity. By leveraging features such as activity tracking, sleep monitoring, and personalized notifications, the Fitbit Sense enables researchers to implement tailored interventions and monitor adherence and progress in a non-invasive manner. Consequently, the Fitbit Sense emerges as an invaluable tool in bariatrics trials, offering insights into the behavioral modifications necessary for effective obesity management [1].
