The Garmin Fenix series, renowned for its advanced multisport features and comprehensive physiological tracking capabilities, plays a pivotal role in enhancing the precision and scope of general physiology trials. Its utility spans across various research domains, from evaluating the impact of environmental interventions on health markers [3,6,18] to facilitating the understanding of recovery and performance dynamics in athletes [21,31]. Specifically, the Garmin Fenix's ability to continuously monitor heart rate, physical activity, and sleep patterns [25] provides invaluable data for assessing the physiological responses to interventions aimed at mitigating heat stress [3,6,18,25]. Moreover, its application in studies focused on optimizing training and recovery strategies [21,31] underscores its versatility in capturing real-time, objective measurements that are critical for tailoring individualized interventions. The Garmin Fenix's integration into these trials not only enriches the data quality but also broadens the potential for discovering nuanced insights into human physiology. By leveraging the Garmin Fenix, researchers can more accurately quantify the effects of specific interventions on physical performance and health status, thereby contributing to the development of evidence-based practices that enhance well-being and athletic achievement [21,25,31].
