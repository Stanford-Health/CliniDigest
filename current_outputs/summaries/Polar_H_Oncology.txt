The purpose of a Polar H in oncology trials is to evaluate the efficacy and feasibility of non-traditional interventions aimed at improving the quality of life and managing stress in cancer patients. Specifically, the Polar H methodology is instrumental in assessing the impact of transcutaneous auricular vagus nerve stimulation on digestive symptoms related to quality of life in ovarian cancer patients undergoing first-line treatment [1], as well as in piloting stress management interventions for patients awaiting cancer scan results [2]. These trials underscore the importance of innovative approaches in supporting the psychological and physiological well-being of cancer patients, highlighting the Polar H's role in pioneering patient-centered care in oncology research.
