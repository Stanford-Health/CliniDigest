The purpose of a Fitbit Sense in obstetrics trials, such as those investigating the efficacy of digital health interventions for managing hypertension in pregnant women [1] and exploring the impact of weight training on pregnancy-related pelvic girdle pain (PPGP) [2], is multifaceted. Primarily, the Fitbit Sense can serve as a critical tool for continuous, real-time monitoring of physiological parameters such as heart rate and activity levels. This capability is essential for assessing the adherence to prescribed exercise regimens [2] and for monitoring the potential impact of these activities on maternal health indicators, including blood pressure [1]. Furthermore, the device's ability to track sleep patterns and stress levels could offer additional insights into the holistic well-being of participants in these studies, thereby providing a comprehensive overview of how lifestyle interventions during pregnancy might influence both maternal and fetal health outcomes.
