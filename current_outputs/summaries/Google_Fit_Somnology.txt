The purpose of Google Fit in somnology trials, as exemplified by the Nextsense Brain-sensing Buds Study [1], is to facilitate the collection and presentation of sleep data to participants, thereby enabling the investigation of how sleep-related feedback affects individuals' sleep quality, behaviors, and psychological states. By leveraging wearable technology like Fitbit, which integrates with Google Fit for data aggregation and analysis, researchers can systematically assess the impact of sleep data feedback on participants' sleep mindset and its subsequent influence on sleep quality, sleepiness, and sleep-related stress and anxiety [1]. This approach underscores the utility of Google Fit as a critical tool in understanding and improving sleep health through technology-enabled, personalized feedback mechanisms in clinical research.
