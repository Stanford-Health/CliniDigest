The Fitbit Charge serves as a pivotal tool in chronic pain or disease trials by facilitating the objective measurement of physical activity and its impact on pain management and overall health outcomes. In the context of chronic low back pain, the Fitbit Charge is utilized to supplement virtual reality therapy, enabling researchers to monitor participants' activity levels and potentially correlate these with changes in pain perception and functional status [5]. This approach underscores the device's utility in capturing quantifiable data on physical activity, which is essential for understanding the relationship between exercise and pain modulation. Furthermore, its application in such trials highlights the broader trend towards integrating wearable technology in clinical research to enhance the precision and relevance of health interventions for chronic conditions.
