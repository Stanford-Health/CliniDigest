The Dreem Headband, designed to monitor and improve sleep quality through advanced sleep tracking and intervention technologies, holds significant potential in pulmonology trials, particularly in the context of managing patients with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU). Given the critical role of sleep quality in the successful weaning of patients from invasive mechanical ventilation [1], the Dreem Headband could serve as a non-invasive, patient-friendly tool to monitor and potentially enhance sleep architecture and reduce sleep disturbances in this vulnerable population. By providing real-time, accurate data on sleep patterns and disturbances, the Dreem Headband could help clinical research coordinators and healthcare teams identify correlations between sleep quality and weaning outcomes, thereby facilitating targeted interventions to improve sleep and potentially reduce the duration of mechanical ventilation, complications, and ICU stay for patients with COPD [1].
