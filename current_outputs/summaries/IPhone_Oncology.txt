The utilization of iPhones in oncology trials signifies a transformative approach towards enhancing patient engagement, monitoring, and intervention in cancer care. Through the integration of mobile health (mHealth) applications and wearable devices, iPhones serve as pivotal tools for remote patient monitoring, symptom management, and the facilitation of behavioral interventions aimed at improving the quality of life and treatment outcomes for cancer patients. For instance, trials such as the optimization of a physical activity promotion intervention [1], the decentralized clinical trial of the EnergyPoints app for managing fatigue in cancer survivors [2], and the use of a mobile app for self-monitoring physical activity with physiotherapy coaching in cancer patients [16] underscore the iPhone's role in delivering tailored interventions and collecting real-time health data. Moreover, the deployment of iPhones in trials evaluating the effectiveness of digital smoking cessation interventions [11], and the remote collection of physiological data to understand cancer's impact [12], further exemplifies their utility in broadening the scope of cancer research by enabling the collection of comprehensive, patient-generated health data. Consequently, iPhones in oncology trials represent a critical component in the evolution of cancer care, moving towards a more personalized, accessible, and data-driven model that promises to improve patient outcomes and advance our understanding of cancer treatment and survivorship.
