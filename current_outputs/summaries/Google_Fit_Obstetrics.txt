The purpose of Google Fit in obstetrics trials, particularly in the context of managing gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM), is to provide a non-invasive, user-friendly platform for monitoring and improving maternal health outcomes. By integrating mobile tracking applications like Google Fit, these trials aim to leverage technology to facilitate daily blood sugar level monitoring and encourage lifestyle modifications. The trial titled "A Novel Device for Gestational Diabetes Control" [1] underscores the potential of mobile apps in enhancing obstetric care by comparing metabolic outcomes in women with GDM using the LUMEN device and app against those using a standard mobile tracking app, highlighting the evolving role of digital health tools in prenatal care.
