The Actigraph CentrePoint Insight serves a pivotal role in oncology trials by facilitating the objective measurement of physical activity and patient engagement through wearable technology. In the context of evaluating patient-reported outcomes (PRO) and physical activity among Japanese patients with advanced breast cancer, the device's integration with smartphone applications allows for real-time, continuous monitoring of patient activity levels and health status [1]. Furthermore, its application in a pilot study assessing the feasibility of exercise interventions prior to pancreatic cancer surgery underscores its utility in preoperative settings, enabling healthcare providers to tailor and optimize patient care based on precise, data-driven insights [2]. This underscores the Actigraph CentrePoint Insight's critical function in enhancing patient-centric research and personalized treatment strategies in oncology.
