The Abbott Freestyle Libre, a continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) system, plays a pivotal role in cardiology trials by offering a non-invasive, real-time insight into the glycemic variability and patterns in patients with cardiovascular diseases (CVD). Its utility is underscored in trials focusing on acute coronary syndrome (ACS) patients, where glycemic parameters measured by the Freestyle Libre Pro iQ have been hypothesized to possess significant prognostic value for cardiovascular clinical events at 12 months [4]. This is particularly relevant given the established link between abnormal glycemia and major cardiovascular events (MACE), highlighting the importance of continuous glucose monitoring in predicting patient outcomes post-ACS. Furthermore, the device's application extends to exploring the association between glycemic variability, hypoglycemia, and cardiac arrhythmias in Type 2 Diabetes (T2D) patients, who are at an elevated risk of CVD [7]. By enabling the monitoring of glucose levels continuously, the Freestyle Libre provides critical data that can be used to adjust patient management plans, potentially reducing the risk of arrhythmias and other cardiovascular complications. Thus, the Abbott Freestyle Libre serves as an essential tool in cardiology trials, offering insights that can lead to improved patient care and outcomes in populations at risk of or suffering from cardiovascular diseases.
