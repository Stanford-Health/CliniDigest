The Dexcom G Pro, a continuous glucose monitoring system, plays a crucial role in bariatrics trials by providing real-time glucose level monitoring, which is essential for the safety and efficacy assessment of treatments for post-bariatric hypoglycemia. In the context of the Avexitide for Treatment of Post-Bariatric Hypoglycemia trial [1], the Dexcom G Pro could be instrumental in accurately tracking the reduction of hypoglycemic events among participants, offering a direct measure of avexitide's effectiveness compared to placebo. Similarly, in the trial assessing Canakinumab for the Treatment of Postprandial Hypoglycemia [2], the device's ability to continuously monitor glucose levels would be vital in determining the treatment's success in improving health-related quality of life by reducing the risk of hypoglycemic events post-bariatric surgery. Thus, the Dexcom G Pro's integration into these trials underscores its value in advancing the understanding and management of post-bariatric hypoglycemia.
