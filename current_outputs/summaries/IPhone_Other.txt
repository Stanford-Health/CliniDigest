The iPhone, as demonstrated through various clinical trials, serves as a versatile tool in enhancing healthcare delivery and patient engagement across multiple domains. Its application ranges from facilitating remote patient monitoring [3], improving dental health through artificial intelligence [2], to supporting mental health interventions [13]. The device's portability and widespread usage make it an ideal platform for deploying mobile health (mHealth) applications designed to monitor, educate, and engage patients in their care processes. For instance, the iPhone's capability to directly connect patients to quality assurance databases [3] exemplifies its role in streamlining data collection and improving the consistency of patient-reported outcomes. Furthermore, its use in telemedicine [17] and as a platform for health behavior modification apps [19] underscores its potential in extending healthcare services beyond traditional settings, thereby enhancing accessibility and convenience for patients. Additionally, the iPhone's utility in clinical research, as seen in trials evaluating its effectiveness in disease monitoring [20] and health behavior interventions [26], highlights its contribution to advancing medical knowledge and patient care practices. Collectively, these trials illustrate the iPhone's multifaceted role in healthcare, emphasizing its capacity to support clinical research coordinators in implementing innovative, patient-centered care solutions.
