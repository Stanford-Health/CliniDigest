The integration of iPhone and similar smartphone technologies in somnology trials underscores a transformative approach towards understanding, monitoring, and intervening in sleep disorders. The versatility of these devices, primarily through applications and wearable connectivity, offers a unique platform for real-time, non-invasive, and patient-friendly data collection and intervention delivery. In the ADAP trial, the use of an Apple Watch Series 7 exemplifies the application of smartphone-connected wearable technology in assessing sleep and related behaviors, such as scratching in individuals with Atopic Dermatitis, in both controlled and naturalistic settings [3]. This trial highlights the potential for iPhones and connected devices to bridge the gap between laboratory precision and the ecological validity of at-home monitoring. Similarly, the exploration of keystroke dynamics via a smartphone app in the study on solriamfetol for treating Multiple Sclerosis fatigue demonstrates an innovative method of utilizing smartphones to capture nuanced changes in fatigue levels, offering insights beyond traditional self-report measures [9]. These instances underscore the iPhone's role not just as a communication device but as a pivotal tool in the advancement of somnology research. By leveraging the widespread availability and multifunctional capabilities of iPhones, researchers can enhance the granularity and scope of sleep studies, paving the way for personalized and accessible sleep health interventions.
