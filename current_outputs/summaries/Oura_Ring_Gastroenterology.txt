The Oura Ring, a wearable device known for its precision in tracking sleep patterns, holds significant potential in gastroenterology trials, particularly those focusing on the interplay between sleep quality and gastrointestinal disorders. In the context of the RISE trial [1], the Oura Ring could serve a pivotal role in objectively measuring sleep parameters among participants with Crohn's disease. This capability is crucial, as the trial aims to assess the impact of insomnia treatment on both sleep quality and secondary outcomes related to Crohn's disease, such as pain and inflammation [1]. By providing accurate, continuous data on sleep stages, duration, and disturbances, the Oura Ring enables researchers to establish a clear link between improvements in sleep and alleviation of gastrointestinal symptoms, thereby offering a non-invasive means to monitor and support patient health in gastroenterology research [1].
