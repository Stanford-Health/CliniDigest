The Garmin Fenix, a sophisticated wearable technology, serves a pivotal role in endocrinology trials by facilitating the monitoring and enhancement of physical activity, which is crucial for managing and understanding endocrine disorders, particularly diabetes. In the context of endocrinology trials, the Garmin Fenix's capabilities are leveraged to track and encourage physical activity among participants, offering researchers valuable data on how lifestyle interventions can impact health outcomes in individuals with conditions like Type 1 Diabetes (T1D) [11]. For instance, the Garmin PACT trial specifically investigates the device's effectiveness in increasing physical activity levels and improving T1D management in children and youth, highlighting the device's potential to contribute to better health outcomes in this demographic [11]. Furthermore, the device's utility in capturing continuous activity data supports research into the complex interplay between physical activity, psychological stress, and glycemic control, offering insights into how wearable technology can aid in the comprehensive management of diabetes by monitoring not just physical activity but also its broader impacts on health and well-being [12]. Thus, the Garmin Fenix emerges as a valuable tool in endocrinology trials, providing a multifaceted approach to understanding and improving the management of endocrine disorders through the lens of physical activity and lifestyle modification.
