The integration of Apple Watch and similar wearable technologies into gastroenterology trials signifies a transformative approach towards enhancing patient care and monitoring. In the context of the CirrhoCare trial, the use of smart-phone technology, which can be extended to include Apple Watch, aims to improve the management and monitoring of patients with decompensated cirrhosis by offering a digital home monitoring solution that is both clinically and cost-effective [1]. This approach not only facilitates real-time data collection but also improves patient access to treatment by enabling remote monitoring. Similarly, in the realm of endoscopic procedures, the exploration of wearable technology's accuracy and safety represents a pioneering step towards ensuring patient safety and enhancing procedural outcomes [2]. The purpose of incorporating Apple Watch in these trials is therefore twofold: to leverage its capabilities for continuous health monitoring and to improve the quality of care for patients undergoing gastroenterological treatments.
