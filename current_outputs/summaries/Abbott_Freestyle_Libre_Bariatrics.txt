The Abbott Freestyle Libre, a continuous glucose monitoring system, plays a crucial role in bariatrics trials by providing real-time insights into glycemic patterns and variability post-surgery [1]. Its application extends beyond traditional monitoring, aiding in the identification of unnoticed hypoglycemia risks and facilitating the evaluation of interventions aimed at mimicking the metabolic benefits of bariatric surgery, such as the combination of diet and GLP-1 medication in type 2 diabetes patients [3]. Although not explicitly mentioned in all trials, its utility in such research underscores the importance of continuous glucose data in optimizing post-bariatric surgery outcomes and developing non-surgical treatment strategies for obesity and diabetes management.
