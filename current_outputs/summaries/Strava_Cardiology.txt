Strava, a popular fitness tracking application, has increasingly found its place in cardiology trials, serving as a novel tool for monitoring patient physical activity and heart rate data in real-time. In the context of the trial titled "Non-invasive Vagal Stimulation for Frequent Premature Ventricular Complexes" [1], Strava's role can be envisioned as a complementary technology for assessing the efficacy of low-level tragus stimulation (LLTS) in patients with frequent premature ventricular complexes (PVCs). By leveraging Strava's capabilities, researchers can obtain valuable insights into the patients' cardiovascular health outside the clinical setting, offering a more comprehensive understanding of the intervention's impact on daily life physical activities and heart health. This integration of Strava into cardiology trials like [1] underscores the potential of digital health tools in enhancing the precision and applicability of clinical research findings, particularly in the domain of non-invasive cardiology interventions.
