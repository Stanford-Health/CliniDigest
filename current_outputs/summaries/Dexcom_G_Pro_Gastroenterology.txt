The Dexcom G Pro, a continuous glucose monitoring system, plays a pivotal role in gastroenterology trials, particularly in studies exploring the intricate relationship between gut microbiota and metabolic health, such as the investigation into the loss of eating control and its association with obesity [1]. By providing real-time insights into glycemic variability, the Dexcom G Pro can offer invaluable data correlating fluctuations in blood glucose levels with changes in gut microbiota composition and functionality [1]. This continuous monitoring is crucial for validating the second hypothesis of the trial, which posits a link between gut microbiota, circulating microRNAs, glycemic variability, and their collective impact on cognitive parameters and brain microstructure [1]. Furthermore, the Dexcom G Pro's ability to track glycemic responses in real-time enhances the understanding of metabolic imbalances related to obesity, thereby supporting the comprehensive analysis of metabolic and behavioral profiles within the cohort [1].
