The Apple HealthKit, as exemplified by the Stanford SpineKeeper trial [1], serves a pivotal role in chronic pain and disease trials by leveraging the capabilities of mobile health applications (mHealth apps) to revolutionize patient care and research methodologies. Through the integration of the Apple ResearchKit and HealthKit platforms, the trial demonstrates the potential for these technologies to facilitate constant, instantaneous, and personalized access to patients [1]. This access is crucial for the delivery of multidisciplinary interventions aimed at improving the quality of life and minimizing symptoms for individuals suffering from chronic conditions, such as low back pain [1]. The purpose of the Apple HealthKit in these trials is thus to provide a framework that supports the development of mHealth apps capable of conducting sophisticated medical research and delivering tailored healthcare interventions directly to patients' mobile devices, thereby enhancing the efficiency and effectiveness of chronic disease management [1].
