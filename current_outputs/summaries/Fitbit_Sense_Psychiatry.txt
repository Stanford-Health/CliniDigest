The integration of wearable technology, such as the Fitbit Sense, into psychiatry trials underscores a transformative approach towards understanding and enhancing mental health through the lens of physical activity and physiological monitoring. The purpose of employing Fitbit Sense in these trials is multifaceted, aiming to assess the feasibility, acceptability, and effectiveness of interventions designed to improve mental health outcomes across diverse populations. In the context of alcohol use disorder, the use of activity trackers is explored to increase physical activity and improve emotional states among in-patients, highlighting the potential of wearable technology to support recovery processes [1]. Similarly, for older adults with intellectual disabilities, the feasibility and acceptability of interventions promoting physical activity and cognitive improvements are investigated, suggesting the adaptability of Fitbit Sense to cater to specific needs of various demographic groups [2]. 

Moreover, the device's role in monitoring and potentially influencing behavior changes in adolescents through physical activity or smartphone use reduction offers insights into preventive strategies for mental health issues, emphasizing the importance of early intervention [4]. In serious mental illness among young adults, the Fitbit Sense supports a lifestyle intervention, indicating its utility in facilitating clinically significant health outcomes [6]. These trials collectively demonstrate the Fitbit Sense's capacity to not only monitor and encourage physical activity but also to serve as a critical tool in psychiatric research for developing personalized, accessible, and effective mental health interventions.
