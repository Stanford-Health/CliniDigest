The purpose of a Biostrap in pulmonology trials, particularly in the context of COVID-19, is to facilitate the comprehensive monitoring of physiological responses in infected individuals over time [1]. By equipping participants with a digital wristband and temperature sensor, researchers aim to collect continuous, real-time data on various health metrics, which is crucial for understanding the progression of respiratory diseases like COVID-19 [1]. This approach allows for the detailed tracking of symptoms and the identification of potential long-term effects, thereby offering insights into why some individuals experience prolonged illness [1]. The integration of wearable technology in such trials represents a significant advancement in pulmonology research, enabling a more nuanced analysis of disease impact and progression through non-invasive means [1].
