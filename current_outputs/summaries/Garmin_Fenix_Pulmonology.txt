The Garmin Fenix series, renowned for its advanced multisport features and health monitoring capabilities, has emerged as a pivotal tool in pulmonology trials, particularly those focused on respiratory illnesses and rehabilitation. Its utility spans from facilitating early detection of infectious respiratory conditions to enhancing pulmonary rehabilitation strategies. In the context of the Infection Watch Study, the Garmin Fenix's ability to monitor physiological parameters could significantly contribute to developing a forecasting model aimed at predicting infection onset before symptoms appear [1]. This predictive capability is crucial, especially for respiratory diseases like COVID-19, where early intervention can dramatically affect outcomes.

Furthermore, the device's potential to support remote monitoring and management of chronic respiratory conditions is evident in trials exploring home-based pulmonary rehabilitation [3]. By providing continuous health data, the Garmin Fenix enables a more personalized and adaptive approach to managing conditions such as bronchiectasis, thereby potentially improving patient outcomes. Additionally, its role in the Wearable Assisted Viral Evidence (WAVE) Study underscores its value in collecting passively-collected data, which is instrumental in understanding the relationship between physical activity, physiological changes, and respiratory viral infections [4].

In essence, the Garmin Fenix's integration into pulmonology trials represents a significant advancement in leveraging wearable technology to enhance respiratory health research. Its capabilities in monitoring, data collection, and predictive analytics offer a promising avenue for improving the management and treatment of respiratory conditions, thereby underscoring its indispensable role in the future of pulmonology trials.
