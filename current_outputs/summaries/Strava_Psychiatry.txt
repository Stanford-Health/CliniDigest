Strava, a social network for athletes to track and share their activities, has not been directly mentioned in the provided trial [1]. However, its potential application in psychiatry trials, particularly those focusing on stress and anxiety reduction, could be significant. By leveraging Strava's activity tracking and social sharing features, researchers could monitor physical activity's impact on mental health in real-time and foster a supportive community among participants. This could enhance the efficacy of interventions like the Haptic Vibrotactile Trigger Technology Patch by providing additional data on physical activity levels and their correlation with stress and anxiety symptoms, offering a more holistic view of patient well-being [1].
