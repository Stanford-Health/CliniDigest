The Abbott Freestyle Libre, while not explicitly mentioned in the provided trial information, plays a crucial role in chronic pain or disease trials by facilitating continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) for diabetic and pre-diabetic patients undergoing neuromodulation therapies [1]. Its purpose in such trials, including the XANADO study, is likely to provide real-time, actionable glucose data. This data is essential for assessing the impact of chronic pain management strategies on glucose levels, thereby enabling a comprehensive evaluation of patient health outcomes. By correlating glucose fluctuations with patient-reported outcomes (PROs) and therapy adjustments, the Freestyle Libre could significantly contribute to personalized patient care and the optimization of treatment protocols for chronic pain in diabetic populations [1].
