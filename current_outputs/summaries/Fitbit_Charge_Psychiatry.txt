The utilization of wearable technology, such as the Fitbit Charge, in psychiatry trials underscores a transformative approach towards monitoring and enhancing mental health interventions. These devices serve multiple purposes: they facilitate the real-time collection of physiological data, support the early detection of neuropsychiatric symptoms, and promote engagement in physical activity as a therapeutic modality. For instance, in the WeSen_delirium trial, wearable sensors are employed to detect early-stage delirium by monitoring vital parameters and movement patterns, highlighting the potential of wearables in identifying acute neuropsychiatric conditions [2]. Similarly, the InMotion trial leverages telehealth and wearable technology to motivate physical activity in individuals with Major Depressive Disorder post-Traumatic Brain Injury, indicating the role of wearables in remotely delivered interventions [3]. Furthermore, the Brightline study integrates data from wearable devices to identify digital biomarkers for mental health conditions in university students, showcasing the potential for wearables in predictive analytics and early intervention [7]. Additionally, the study on predicting violent outbursts in pediatric psychiatry wards utilizes wearable devices to monitor physiological measures, demonstrating the application of wearables in managing and anticipating behavioral symptoms in vulnerable populations [8]. Collectively, these trials illustrate the multifaceted utility of the Fitbit Charge in psychiatry research, from enhancing diagnostic accuracy and intervention delivery to fostering a deeper understanding of the physiological underpinnings of mental health conditions.
