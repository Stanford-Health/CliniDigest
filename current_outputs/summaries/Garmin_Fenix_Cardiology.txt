The Garmin Fenix series, renowned for its advanced multisport features and health monitoring capabilities, plays a pivotal role in cardiology trials by facilitating the collection of precise, real-time data on physical activity, heart rate, and other physiological parameters critical for cardiovascular health research. In the realm of cardiology, the utilization of such wearable technology is instrumental in enhancing the accuracy of physical activity monitoring and adherence to prescribed exercise regimens, as evidenced in trials focused on secondary prevention strategies for cardiac patients [1]. Specifically, the Garmin Fenix's capabilities to track and record detailed metrics on exercise intensity, duration, and frequency offer invaluable insights for studies aiming to improve exercise capacity and adherence to cardiac prevention strategies through personalized feedback and interventions [1]. Moreover, its application in digital health interventions, such as those targeting children with congenital heart disease, underscores its potential to monitor and promote physical activity levels in specific patient populations, thereby contributing to improved health outcomes and quality of life [11]. The Garmin Fenix's integration into cardiology trials exemplifies the growing importance of wearable technology in advancing cardiovascular health research, offering a non-invasive, patient-friendly means of gathering comprehensive data essential for developing effective, evidence-based interventions and management strategies for heart disease.
