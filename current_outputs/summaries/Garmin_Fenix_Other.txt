The Garmin Fenix, as exemplified in the trial [1], serves a pivotal role in clinical research by facilitating the collection of Real World Data (RWD) through its advanced wearable sensor technology. In trials similar to [1], the Garmin Fenix's capabilities can be harnessed for continuous, passive monitoring of patient health metrics outside of traditional clinical settings. This enables researchers to gather comprehensive, longitudinal data on patient conditions, such as Parkinson's Disease, enhancing the development of personalized treatment plans and medication optimization. The device's utility in noninterventional, observational studies [1] underscores its potential to revolutionize data collection methodologies, offering a more nuanced understanding of disease progression and treatment efficacy in real-time.
