The purpose of Google Fit in oncology trials, as exemplified by the study on the accuracy of a mobile sensor-based system for detecting chemotherapy toxicity in older adults with cancer in a developing country [1], is to leverage commercially available technology to enhance patient care. By utilizing an accelerometer-equipped smartphone to monitor physical activity, specifically the number of steps taken per day, Google Fit can serve as a critical tool in remotely detecting chemotherapy toxicity in vulnerable populations [1]. This approach not only addresses the challenges of access to care in developing countries but also introduces a patient-centered measure that could potentially transform cancer care delivery. The trial demonstrates that a decline in daily steps, as measured by Google Fit or similar applications, can be an early indicator of chemotherapy-related toxicities, thereby facilitating timely medical intervention and potentially improving patient outcomes [1].
