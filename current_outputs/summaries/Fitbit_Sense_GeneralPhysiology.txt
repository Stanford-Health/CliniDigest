The Fitbit Sense, a commercially available triaxial accelerometer, plays a pivotal role in general physiology trials by facilitating the monitoring and encouragement of physical activity across diverse populations. Its utility is demonstrated in trials aimed at increasing daily steps and reducing sedentary behaviors among various groups, including rural veterans [1], university students [2], and older adults [6]. The device's ability to track progress in real-time and integrate with mobile applications, such as VA MapTrek and Let's Move, underscores its value in behavioral interventions designed to promote healthier lifestyles. Furthermore, the Fitbit Sense's capacity for continuous heart rate monitoring is leveraged in studies exploring its potential for early illness detection among students at risk for COVID-19 [3], showcasing its versatility beyond physical activity tracking. This adaptability is further evidenced in its application to hospital settings in low and middle-income countries, where it serves as an alternative to traditional bedside monitors for continuous patient monitoring [9]. Collectively, these trials illustrate the Fitbit Sense's significant contribution to general physiology research by providing a reliable, user-friendly tool for data collection and intervention delivery, ultimately supporting efforts to enhance physical activity, monitor health indicators, and improve overall well-being across varied populations.
