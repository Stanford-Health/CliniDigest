The iPhone, as demonstrated in nephrology trials, serves a multifaceted purpose by enhancing patient engagement, data collection, and remote monitoring in the management of kidney-related diseases. In the GentleCathâ„¢ Air Intermittent Catheter Smartwatch Real Life Pilot Study, the iPhone app is utilized for maintaining a Daily Fluid Diary and testing the feasibility of using the device's microphone to capture bladder emptying, highlighting its role in improving self-care and monitoring in patients undergoing intermittent catheterization [1]. Furthermore, the feasibility study of a mHealth platform for remote patient monitoring underscores the iPhone's potential in facilitating comprehensive health management for CKD and Peritoneal Dialysis patients by enabling data entry, symptom tracking, and communication with healthcare providers [2]. Collectively, these trials underscore the iPhone's pivotal role in advancing nephrology care through innovative technological solutions.
