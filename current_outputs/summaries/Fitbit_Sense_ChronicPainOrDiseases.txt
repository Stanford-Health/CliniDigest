The purpose of utilizing Fitbit Sense in chronic pain or disease trials is multifaceted, primarily focusing on enhancing physical activity, monitoring health metrics, and improving the quality of life among patients with various chronic conditions. In the OPAM-IA trial, the integration of a Fitbit device with a physical activity coaching model underscores the device's role in facilitating increased physical activity and reducing sedentary behavior among patients with inflammatory arthritis, thereby aiming to alleviate pain and improve mobility [1]. Although not explicitly mentioned in the other trials, the underlying principle of employing wearable technology like Fitbit Sense can be inferred to closely align with the objectives of monitoring physical function and activity levels. For instance, in trials aimed at improving health outcomes for older adults with chronic pain through engagement in physical and mind-body activities, the use of step-count and performance-based measures like the six-minute walk test could potentially benefit from the precise and continuous tracking capabilities of Fitbit Sense [2,4]. Similarly, in the context of home-based monitoring for Parkinson's disease, the device's ability to track physical activity measures could complement the study's goal of detecting impairments and predicting disease progression [5]. Therefore, Fitbit Sense serves as a critical tool in chronic pain or disease trials by enabling accurate tracking of physical activity, offering insights into patient health and behavior, and supporting interventions aimed at enhancing patient well-being and disease management.
