The Dexcom G Pro, a continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) system, plays a pivotal role in oncology trials by providing comprehensive insights into the metabolic and glycemic impacts of cancer treatments. In the context of breast cancer, where treatments such as aromatase inhibitors are known to influence cardiovascular and metabolic health, the Dexcom G Pro facilitates the real-time tracking of glucose levels. This capability is crucial for assessing the short-term effects of endocrine therapy on glycemic regulation, as highlighted in the second trial, which examines the therapy's impact on body composition, bone mineral density, and glycemic control through continuous glucose monitoring in free-living conditions [2]. By enabling the continuous, non-invasive monitoring of glucose levels, the Dexcom G Pro aids in identifying potential metabolic dysregulations early in the treatment process, thereby contributing to the development of more personalized and effective oncology care strategies.
