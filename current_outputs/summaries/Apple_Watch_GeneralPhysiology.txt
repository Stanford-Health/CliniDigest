The Apple Watch has emerged as a pivotal tool in general physiology trials, serving multiple roles that range from monitoring physical activity and health metrics to facilitating personalized health interventions. Its utility is underscored by its ability to provide continuous, real-time data on various physiological parameters, such as heart rate, activity levels, and even cognitive function, in both clinical and real-life settings [5,6]. For instance, in the realm of physical activity, the Apple Watch's capabilities are leveraged to evaluate the impact of personalized move goals on daily step count and workout quality, thereby offering insights into how technology can enhance physical activity engagement among adults [2]. Furthermore, its application extends to specialized populations, such as older adults, where it aids in assessing the effects of medication deprescription on physical function, showcasing its potential in geriatric care [5]. The device also plays a critical role in innovative health interventions, such as the Geriatric Acute & Post-acute Care Coordination Program, by monitoring fitness and falls, thus contributing to fall prevention strategies in older populations [9]. Additionally, its integration into studies focusing on the mental and physical status of specific groups, like US Military Special Operation Forces, highlights its versatility in monitoring a wide range of physiological and behavioral health data, supporting comprehensive health management and performance optimization [16]. Collectively, these trials illustrate the Apple Watch's significant contribution to advancing personalized healthcare, promoting physical activity, and enhancing the management of health conditions through innovative, data-driven approaches.
