The Dreem Headband, in the context of bariatric trials, is posited to play a crucial role in monitoring and understanding the complex interplay of sleep patterns, energy expenditure, and metabolic changes during weight loss and regain phases in adolescents with obesity [1]. By providing detailed insights into sleep architecture and its impact on energy metabolism, the Dreem Headband aims to identify critical periods of metabolic adaptation that contribute to weight regain, thereby offering a novel approach to enhance the effectiveness of obesity treatment programs by tailoring interventions to prevent these energy consequences and support sustained weight management [1].
