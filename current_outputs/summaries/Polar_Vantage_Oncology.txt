The purpose of a Polar Vantage in oncology trials, such as the study on the impact of a high-fiber diet on the gut microbiota during neoadjuvant treatment for triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) patients [1], is multifaceted. Primarily, it serves as a tool for accurately monitoring physical activity and mood, key confounding factors that can influence the gut microbiome and patient outcomes [1]. By providing precise and continuous data on patient activity levels and potentially mood through associated metrics, the Polar Vantage can enhance the quality of dietary intervention studies by allowing researchers to control for these variables, thereby isolating the effects of dietary changes on the gut microbiota and overall patient health [1]. This capability is crucial for validating the hypothesis that a high-fiber diet can preserve gut microbial diversity and improve patient satisfaction with supportive care during treatment [1].
