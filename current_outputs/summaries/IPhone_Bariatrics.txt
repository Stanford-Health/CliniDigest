The integration of iPhones and related mobile technologies into bariatric trials signifies a transformative approach towards addressing obesity and related eating disorders by leveraging digital health interventions. These trials illustrate the iPhone's role in facilitating innovative, accessible, and personalized health solutions that cater to the diverse needs of individuals struggling with obesity. For instance, the use of wearable activity trackers in pharmacotherapy trials [1] underscores the iPhone's utility in monitoring physical activity and enhancing patient engagement with weight loss medications. Similarly, the feasibility study of a digital therapeutic for adults with binge eating and obesity [2] highlights how iPhones can deliver therapeutic content directly to users, enabling real-time support and intervention. The development of app-based interventions, such as the BrainWeighve weight loss app [3], further exemplifies the iPhone's capacity to host interactive applications that educate, motivate, and track the progress of individuals with obesity, thereby addressing the epidemic from a preventative and treatment-based perspective. Moreover, the addiction-based mobile health weight loss intervention [6] and the exploration of digital behavioral weight loss approaches [7] demonstrate the iPhone's role in providing a platform for comprehensive, behavior modification strategies that are essential for sustainable weight management. Collectively, these trials reveal the iPhone's pivotal role in bariatric research as a tool for delivering personalized, evidence-based interventions that can significantly impact public health outcomes related to obesity.
