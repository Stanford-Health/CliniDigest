The iPhone, with its advanced sensors and widespread availability, has emerged as a pivotal tool in general physiology trials, facilitating innovative approaches to health monitoring, intervention, and research methodologies. Its utility spans from enabling remote patient monitoring and intervention to enhancing data collection accuracy and participant engagement in diverse physiological studies. For instance, the iPhone's capabilities are leveraged in the CatchU app for assessing multisensory integration and fall risk in older adults [11], demonstrating its role in improving clinical assessments through mobile technology. Similarly, its application in the Apple Hearing Study underscores the iPhone's potential in longitudinal health monitoring, particularly in understanding the impact of sound exposure on hearing health over time [23]. The device's integration into the mHealth domain is further exemplified by its use in evaluating the effectiveness of personalized move goals on physical activity, highlighting its contribution to personalized health interventions [31]. Moreover, the iPhone's role in the DETECT study, which utilizes app-based tracking of physiological changes for early detection of influenza-like illnesses, showcases its capacity for large-scale health surveillance and early intervention [55]. Collectively, these trials underscore the iPhone's transformative impact on general physiology research, offering a versatile platform for innovative health solutions, personalized care, and enhanced participant engagement in clinical studies.
