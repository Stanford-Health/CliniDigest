The Whoop Strap serves as a pivotal tool in cardiology trials by leveraging its advanced wearable technology to monitor and analyze critical health metrics such as heart rate variability (HRV), heart rate, and sleep patterns. Its application ranges from assessing the feasibility of personalized training recommendations based on HRV for improving aerobic exercise performance [1], to evaluating the accuracy of its ECG classification algorithms in identifying various heart rhythms [2]. Furthermore, it is instrumental in testing the sensitivity and specificity of PPG-based algorithms for detecting atrial fibrillation against gold-standard wearable ECG patches [3]. In the context of secondary prevention in young ischemic stroke patients, the Whoop Strap is utilized to monitor health metrics, thereby facilitating personalized care aimed at reducing recurrent strokes and improving cardiovascular health outcomes [4]. Collectively, these trials underscore the Whoop Strap's versatility and potential in advancing cardiology research and patient care.
