The utilization of iPhones in psychiatry trials represents a transformative approach towards integrating digital health technologies in mental health research and treatment. These devices serve as versatile tools for delivering interventions, monitoring symptoms, and facilitating patient engagement in a variety of psychiatric conditions. For instance, iPhones are employed to deliver cognitive behavioral therapy-based mobile interventions for adolescent depression [2], support smoking cessation through applications like iCanQuit [5], and provide stress management training to college students [6]. Additionally, they enable the implementation of innovative treatments such as the MYPLAN app for managing crises in individuals at risk of suicide [10], and the JoyPop app for improving emotion regulation among Indigenous youth [13]. The trials also highlight the iPhone's role in facilitating remote health interventions, such as the use of wearable devices for post-Covid symptom management [7], and in supporting research into the efficacy of digital therapeutics for conditions like schizophrenia [19] and PTSD [20]. Furthermore, iPhones are instrumental in collecting patient-reported outcomes and facilitating real-time data analysis, as seen in the study of tobacco cessation [23]. This integration of iPhones in psychiatry trials underscores a broader shift towards personalized, accessible, and data-driven mental health care, leveraging the ubiquity and computing power of smartphones to advance psychiatric research and improve patient outcomes [1,2,5,6,7,10,13,19,20,23].
