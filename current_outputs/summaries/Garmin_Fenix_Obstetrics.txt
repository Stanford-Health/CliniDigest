The Garmin Fenix, a sophisticated wearable device, serves a pivotal role in obstetrics trials by facilitating comprehensive data collection on maternal health parameters. In the context of these trials, the Garmin Fenix is instrumental in monitoring physical activity, sleep patterns, and overall well-being of pregnant and postpartum women. Specifically, in the Feasibility of a Prenatal Yoga Mobile App in African American Pregnant Women trial, the Garmin Fenix is utilized to track daily physical activity and potentially other health metrics of participants engaging in a prenatal yoga program, aiming to assess the impact on maternal and child health outcomes [3]. This underscores the device's utility in gathering real-time, objective data that can enrich our understanding of maternal health behaviors and their effects, thereby supporting the development of targeted interventions to promote optimal pregnancy and postpartum outcomes.
