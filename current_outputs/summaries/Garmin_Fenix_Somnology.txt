The Garmin Fenix series, as a sophisticated wearable technology, plays a pivotal role in somnology trials by providing accurate, real-time data on sleep patterns, quality, and physiological responses during sleep. This utility is underscored in trials that aim to validate the accuracy and reliability of wearable devices in tracking sleep-related metrics against standard polysomnographic measures [5]. The Garmin Fenix's capabilities extend beyond mere sleep tracking; its integration into clinical research facilitates a deeper understanding of sleep's impact on overall health, behavioral outcomes, and the efficacy of therapeutic interventions. For instance, its use in pediatric sleep and behavior monitoring trials [1] demonstrates its potential in capturing sleep's nuanced effects on developmental health. Furthermore, its application in studies investigating the effects of dietary supplements [3] and herbal extracts [6] on sleep quality highlights its versatility in assessing lifestyle and nutritional interventions. The Garmin Fenix's contribution to somnology research is invaluable, offering a non-invasive, patient-friendly means of gathering comprehensive sleep data. This, in turn, supports the development of targeted, evidence-based approaches to improving sleep health and, by extension, general well-being.
