The Whoop Strap serves a pivotal role in oncology trials by enabling the remote evaluation of resting heart rate and heart rate variability (HRV), critical markers of autonomic dysfunction (AD) which is prevalent among cancer survivors [1]. This wearable technology offers a non-invasive, convenient method for continuous monitoring outside the clinical setting, thereby overcoming the limitations of traditional in-office measurements. By comparing its efficacy and accuracy against established in-office tools like the AtCor Medical SphygmoCor HRV Software, the trial aims to validate the Whoop Strap's utility in assessing the cardiovascular health of Hodgkin lymphoma survivors who have undergone chest radiation [1]. This approach not only facilitates the early detection of AD, which is associated with increased mortality and reduced quality of life among cancer survivors, but also underscores the potential of wearable technology in enhancing patient care and monitoring in oncology research [1].
