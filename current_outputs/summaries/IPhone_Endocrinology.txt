The integration of iPhone technology in endocrinology trials signifies a transformative approach towards enhancing patient engagement, data accuracy, and real-time monitoring in the management of endocrine disorders. Through the utilization of mobile applications, such as the PortionSize™ and MyFitnessPal© apps, iPhones serve as pivotal tools for accurately measuring energy and nutrient intake in free-living conditions, thereby facilitating dietary management in conditions like diabetes [1,30]. Moreover, the application of iPhones in trials like the SMART-ER study, which utilizes patient-reported outcome surveys via smartphone apps, underscores the device's capability in improving symptom management interventions and supporting treatment adherence in endocrine therapies [6]. The development and validation of mobile apps, such as the MAGHD App for managing Adult Growth Hormone Deficiency, further exemplify the iPhone's role in personalizing patient care and enhancing clinician-patient communication [17]. Additionally, iPhones are instrumental in digital therapeutic interventions aimed at improving glycemic control in Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus, offering a platform for behavioral therapy delivery and patient self-management [7,9]. Collectively, these trials illustrate the iPhone's multifaceted utility in endocrinology research, from facilitating dietary and symptom monitoring to delivering personalized therapeutic interventions and improving patient outcomes in endocrine disorders.
