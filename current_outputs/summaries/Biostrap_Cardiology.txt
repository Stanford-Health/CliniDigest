The purpose of a Biostrap in cardiology trials is multifaceted, primarily focusing on enhancing patient monitoring and outcomes through advanced technology. In the realm of cardiothoracic surgery, Biostrap's role is pivotal in utilizing machine learning to analyze high-resolution data for early detection and prediction of postoperative complications, thereby facilitating timely interventions [1]. Furthermore, in the context of COVID-19, the device's utility extends to monitoring long-term cardiovascular and behavioral impacts of the disease, underscoring its significance in managing pandemic-related health consequences [2]. Additionally, Biostrap's capability to measure Photoplethysmography (PPG) signals offers a non-invasive method to predict ejection fraction and other critical echographic data, potentially revolutionizing the way cardiologists assess heart function and diagnose various cardiac conditions in the general population [3]. Collectively, these trials underscore Biostrap's integral role in advancing cardiological research and patient care by leveraging wearable technology for continuous, precise health monitoring.
