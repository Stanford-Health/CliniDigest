The purpose of an Apple Watch in clinical trials, such as those investigating the efficacy of medical devices or interventions [1,2], extends beyond simple timekeeping to include patient monitoring and data collection. In trials like the one comparing knee implant devices [1], an Apple Watch could be utilized to monitor patients' physical activity levels and rehabilitation progress post-surgery. Similarly, in studies exploring interventions for preventing noise-induced hearing loss [2], the device could track environmental noise exposure and physiological responses in real-time. Thus, the Apple Watch serves as a versatile tool in clinical research, enhancing data accuracy and patient engagement in diverse medical studies.
