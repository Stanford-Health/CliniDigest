The Fitbit Charge serves as a pivotal tool in general physiology trials, primarily aimed at enhancing physical activity, monitoring health parameters, and facilitating behavior change interventions across diverse populations. Its application ranges from augmenting intervention delivery in community-based programs targeting older adults' physical activity by integrating behavior change strategies [1], to serving as a monitoring device in studies assessing the impact of interventions on body composition, physical activity, sleep quality, and stress among hospital nurses [8]. Furthermore, the Fitbit Charge is instrumental in evaluating the effectiveness of notifications on activity, sleep, and nutrition for improving health conditions, intellectual function, and physical function in older adults [9]. This wide-ranging utility underscores the device's capability not only in tracking and encouraging physical activity but also in contributing valuable data for analyzing the outcomes of various health interventions. By providing real-time feedback and enabling the collection of continuous physiological data, the Fitbit Charge facilitates a deeper understanding of the relationship between lifestyle behaviors and health outcomes. Consequently, its use in physiology trials represents a significant step forward in personalized health monitoring and intervention, highlighting its role in advancing research aimed at improving quality of life and health outcomes across different demographic groups.
