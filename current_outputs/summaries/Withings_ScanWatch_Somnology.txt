The Withings ScanWatch emerges as a pivotal tool in somnology trials, particularly in studies like "The Effect of Orofacial Myofunctional Therapy With Autofeedback on Obstructive Sleep Apnea" [1]. Its purpose extends beyond mere timekeeping to encompass comprehensive sleep monitoring and auto-feedback functionalities. In the context of the trial [1], the ScanWatch could serve a dual role. Firstly, as an auto-monitoring device, it can continuously track sleep patterns, disturbances, and potential apneas, providing invaluable data for assessing the effectiveness of orofacial myofunctional therapy (OMT) in improving sleep apnea symptoms. Secondly, its feedback capabilities could enhance patient adherence to OMT by offering real-time insights into sleep quality and therapy progress. This dual functionality not only aids in the precise measurement of therapy outcomes but also in identifying anatomical and behavioral predictors of treatment adherence, thereby underscoring the ScanWatch's utility in advancing somnology research [1].
