The integration of Fitbit Sense devices into oncology trials represents a pivotal shift towards personalized and remote monitoring of cancer patients, aiming to enhance the quality of life, improve physical activity levels, and provide valuable insights into patient health metrics outside of the clinical setting. In trials focused on cancer survivors, Fitbits are employed to monitor and encourage the maintenance of physical activity, which is crucial for mitigating health disparities and improving outcomes in this population [1]. Specifically, the use of Fitbit devices in a decentralized clinical trial setting allows for the remote monitoring of fatigue and sleep patterns in cancer survivors, offering a novel approach to understanding the impact of self-acupressure interventions facilitated by mobile health apps [2]. Furthermore, Fitbits serve as essential tools in evaluating the feasibility and effectiveness of physical activity regimens in patients with advanced-stage lung cancer, aiming to increase overall step count, adherence to activity recommendations, and potentially influence markers of inflammation and cancer progression [5]. Additionally, in the context of primary brain tumor patients, Fitbits offer a non-invasive method to assess sleep disturbances and circadian rhythms, providing insights that could inform future treatment and supportive care strategies [10]. Collectively, these trials underscore the Fitbit Sense's role in oncology research as a means to collect real-time, objective data on physical activity, sleep quality, and other health metrics, thereby supporting the development of tailored interventions that address the unique needs of cancer patients and survivors.
