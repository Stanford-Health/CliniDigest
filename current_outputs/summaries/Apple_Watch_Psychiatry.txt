The Apple Watch has emerged as a pivotal tool in psychiatry trials, serving multiple purposes ranging from monitoring biometric data to delivering interventions aimed at improving mental health outcomes. Its utility is underscored by its ability to continuously collect data on activity, sleep, and other physiological parameters in real-time, offering a non-invasive method to assess and potentially predict mental health states [1]. For instance, in trials focused on traumatic brain injury, the Apple Watch plays a crucial role in monitoring service members' health by tracking biometric and activity data, thereby facilitating early identification of brain injuries and aiding in the recovery process [1]. Additionally, its application in managing mental health conditions is evident in studies exploring interventions for anxiety and PTSD, where the device's capabilities to monitor heart rate variability and deliver therapeutic interventions directly to participants have shown promise in reducing symptoms [3,12]. Furthermore, the integration of mindfulness and biofeedback interventions through wearable devices demonstrates the potential to reduce stress and promote psychological health among caregivers of individuals with dementia, highlighting the versatility of the Apple Watch in addressing a broad spectrum of psychiatric conditions [6]. The Apple Watch's role in psychiatry trials extends beyond mere data collection; it is instrumental in delivering personalized, real-time interventions that can significantly impact mental health treatment and management [2,12]. Thus, the Apple Watch represents a significant advancement in the field of psychiatry, offering innovative solutions for monitoring, intervention, and ultimately improving mental health outcomes.
