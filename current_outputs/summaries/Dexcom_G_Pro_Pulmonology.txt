The Dexcom G Pro, a continuous glucose monitoring system, plays a pivotal role in pulmonology trials, particularly in the context of managing cystic fibrosis (CF), where nutritional status and glucose metabolism significantly impact lung function and overall health. In the trial titled "Strength and Muscle Related Outcomes for Nutrition and Lung Function in CF" [1], the emphasis on evaluating nutritional interventions and their correlation with lung function underscores the importance of closely monitoring glucose levels to tailor nutritional strategies effectively. The Dexcom G Pro can provide continuous, real-time glucose monitoring, offering invaluable data that can be correlated with changes in lung function, nutritional status, and body composition [1]. This capability is crucial for identifying glycemic patterns that may contribute to nutritional failure in adults with advanced lung disease, thereby facilitating more personalized and effective interventions to improve patient outcomes in CF [1].
