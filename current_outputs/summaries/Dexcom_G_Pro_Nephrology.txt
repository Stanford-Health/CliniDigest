The Dexcom G Pro, a continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) device, plays a pivotal role in nephrology trials by offering a nuanced understanding of glycemic control in patients with kidney diseases, particularly those undergoing dialysis or with end-stage renal disease (ESRD). Its primary purpose in these trials is to assess the efficacy of CGM over traditional methods like glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) in monitoring and managing diabetes in patients with compromised kidney function [1]. This is crucial because maintaining optimal glucose levels in patients with kidney diseases can be challenging due to the altered physiology and medication effects. Furthermore, the Dexcom G Pro facilitates the investigation of the impact of glycemic control on the quality of life, hypoglycemia risk, and overall diabetes management in hemodialysis patients, offering insights into how continuous glucose monitoring can enhance patient care and outcomes [5]. By providing real-time glucose data, the Dexcom G Pro supports the implementation of personalized diabetes management plans, potentially reducing the risk of diabetes-related complications in the kidney-diseased population. Additionally, its use in trials involving kidney transplant recipients underscores its value in exploring how CGM can aid in the post-transplant care by optimizing glycemic control, thereby contributing to the longevity of the transplant and enhancing patient well-being [3]. Collectively, these trials underscore the Dexcom G Pro's utility in advancing nephrology care by enabling a more precise and continuous assessment of glucose levels, which is paramount in managing the complex interplay between diabetes and kidney disease.
