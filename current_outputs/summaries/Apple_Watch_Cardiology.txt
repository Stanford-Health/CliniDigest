The Apple Watch has emerged as a pivotal tool in cardiology trials, serving multiple purposes ranging from monitoring and detection to patient management and intervention. Its utility is underscored by its non-invasive nature, continuous monitoring capabilities, and potential to enhance patient outcomes through early detection and intervention strategies. In trials, the Apple Watch has been employed to monitor heart rhythm and blood pressure in patients with chronic conditions, offering insights into the frequency and severity of episodes [1]. It has also been pivotal in detecting atrial fibrillation (AF) in stroke patients, comparing favorably with implantable cardiac monitors (ICMs) and showcasing its potential as a less invasive, cost-effective alternative [2]. Furthermore, the device's ability to support randomized controlled trials investigating the efficacy of time-delimited anticoagulation guided by AF detection underscores its role in personalized medicine [3]. The Apple Watch's capabilities extend to pediatric cardiology, where its accuracy in ECG tracings and heart rate monitoring is being evaluated [19], and to the validation of its diagnostic performance augmented with artificial intelligence algorithms in detecting arrhythmias [20]. These trials collectively highlight the Apple Watch's transformative potential in cardiology research, offering a versatile, patient-friendly tool that can significantly impact the management and understanding of cardiovascular diseases.
