The Withings Body+ scale serves a pivotal role in bariatrics trials, particularly in the context of monitoring patients with severe obesity undergoing treatment with WegovyÂ® [1]. Its primary purpose is to facilitate the collection of comprehensive real-world data, encompassing not only body weight but also detailed body composition metrics. This includes the assessment of cardiovascular and neurovegetative parameters, which are crucial for understanding the holistic impact of obesity treatments on patient health [1]. The integration of such a connected device into clinical trials underscores the shift towards leveraging digital health tools to enhance the precision and scope of data collection. This approach enables researchers to capture a nuanced picture of treatment efficacy, patient progress, and overall health outcomes in a real-world setting, thereby enriching the evidence base for bariatric interventions [1].
