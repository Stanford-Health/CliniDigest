The purpose of employing Elite HRV in cardiology trials, as exemplified by the study on the effects of Zazen meditation in patients with acute myocardial infarction [1], is to provide a sophisticated and accurate measure of heart rate variability (HRV). This is crucial for assessing the autonomic nervous system's response to interventions aimed at improving cardiovascular health. The trial [1] utilizes HRV as a key indicator to evaluate the physiological impact of meditation on patients recovering from myocardial infarction, highlighting HRV's significance in monitoring stress and cardiac function, thereby underscoring its value in cardiac rehabilitation research.
