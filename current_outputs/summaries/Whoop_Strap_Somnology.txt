In the realm of somnology trials, particularly those investigating interventions for insomnia, the Whoop Strap emerges as a pivotal tool for the objective and continuous monitoring of sleep physiology and quality. Within the context of the trial titled "Evaluation of an Oral Cannabidiol (CBD)-Terpene Formulation on Sleep Physiology in Participants With Insomnia" [1], the Whoop Strap could serve a critical role in quantifying the impact of the Defined CBD on various sleep parameters. By leveraging its advanced biometric tracking capabilities, the Whoop Strap can provide invaluable data on sleep stages, disturbances, and overall sleep efficiency, offering a nuanced understanding of how CBD-terpene formulations influence sleep patterns in individuals with insomnia [1]. This data is essential not only for assessing the efficacy of the intervention but also for tailoring future treatments to enhance sleep quality in this population.
