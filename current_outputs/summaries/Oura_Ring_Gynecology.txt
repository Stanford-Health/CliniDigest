The Oura Ring, a wearable technology, is increasingly utilized in gynecology trials to explore its potential in enhancing female reproductive health outcomes. By monitoring physiological parameters, such as sleep patterns [2] and menstrual cycles [1], the Oura Ring offers a non-invasive method to gather critical data. These trials aim to understand the intricate relationships between sleep, menstrual health, and fertility [2], and to integrate this data into personalized treatment plans for conditions like infertility [3]. The ultimate goal is to leverage wearable technology to inform and improve gynecological care and fertility treatments, demonstrating the Oura Ring's value in clinical research and patient care within the field of gynecology.
