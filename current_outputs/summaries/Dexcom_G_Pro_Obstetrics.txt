The Dexcom G Pro, a real-time continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) system, plays a pivotal role in obstetrics trials by aiming to enhance the management and outcomes of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) through improved glycemic control and monitoring. The primary purpose of integrating Dexcom G Pro in these trials is to address the limitations of traditional self-monitoring blood glucose (SMBG) methods, which often provide an incomplete picture of glucose levels due to infrequent testing and potential inaccuracies in self-reporting [1]. By offering real-time glucose data and alerts for rapid glucose changes, Dexcom G Pro facilitates early identification of glycemic excursions, enabling timely behavioral or pharmacological interventions [2]. This capability is crucial in reducing the risk of adverse obstetric outcomes, which are a significant concern in GDM management. Furthermore, the Dexcom G Pro's ability to detect greater glycemic variability presents an opportunity to tailor treatment strategies more effectively, potentially improving both maternal and fetal outcomes by reducing the incidence of macrosomia and the need for interventions such as cesarean sections [6]. Additionally, the device's utility in monitoring glucose levels during labor and delivery highlights its potential to mitigate neonatal hypoglycemia by ensuring tighter glycemic control [12]. Collectively, these trials underscore the Dexcom G Pro's potential to revolutionize GDM care by offering a more comprehensive and accurate assessment of glucose levels, thereby enhancing the safety and well-being of both mothers and their offspring.
