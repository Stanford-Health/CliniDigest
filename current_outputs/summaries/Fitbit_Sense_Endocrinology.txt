The Fitbit Sense serves a pivotal role in endocrinology trials by facilitating the objective monitoring of physical activity and sleep patterns, which are crucial for managing diabetes. In pediatric type 1 diabetes, it is used to assess the impact of insulin pumps on sleep quality and overnight blood sugar control [1]. Although not explicitly mentioned in the other trials, the technology's capability to track activity levels and physiological responses could similarly support interventions aimed at reducing sedentary behavior in type 2 diabetes [2] and promoting physical activity through behavioral economics in adolescents and young adults with type 2 diabetes or prediabetes [3]. This underscores the Fitbit Sense's utility in enhancing the understanding and management of diabetes through lifestyle and behavioral modifications.
