The Dreem Headband, a device designed for monitoring and enhancing sleep quality through advanced brainwave analysis, holds significant potential in general physiology trials, particularly those investigating the immune system's response to various stimuli [1]. By integrating the Dreem Headband into studies like the one exploring vaccine and antigen challenges for immune monitoring [1], researchers can gain invaluable insights into the intricate relationship between sleep patterns and immune function. This integration could elucidate how sleep quality and duration impact the efficacy of immune responses to vaccines and antigens, thereby offering a more holistic understanding of human physiology and the interconnectedness of sleep and immune health [1].
