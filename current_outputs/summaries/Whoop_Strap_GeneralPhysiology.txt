The Whoop Strap serves as a critical tool in general physiology trials by continuously monitoring a wide array of biometric data, including heart rate variability, resting heart rate, total sleep time, and more, to assess the impact of various interventions on health, recovery, and performance[2]. Its utilization across diverse studies, from evaluating the effects of cold water immersion on athlete recovery[2] to understanding the physiological consequences of decreased sleep and recovery in healthcare workers[4,5], underscores its versatility and reliability in capturing objective physiological feedback essential for optimizing health outcomes and enhancing performance in both athletic and high-stress professional settings.
