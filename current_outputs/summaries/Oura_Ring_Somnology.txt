The Oura Ring, a wearable device designed for sleep tracking, plays a pivotal role in somnology trials by providing objective, quantifiable data on sleep parameters that are crucial for evaluating the efficacy of various interventions aimed at improving sleep quality and related health outcomes. In the realm of clinical research, particularly in studies focused on sleep, the accuracy and reliability of data collection methods are paramount. The Oura Ring serves this purpose by offering a non-invasive, user-friendly means of gathering detailed sleep metrics, including sleep onset latency, time spent in different sleep stages, and nocturnal awakenings [3]. This capability is instrumental in trials examining the impact of nutritional interventions [1], herbal extracts [3], and digital cognitive behavioral therapy [4] on sleep quality, as it allows researchers to objectively measure changes in sleep patterns and correlate them with subjective reports of sleep quality and daytime functioning. Furthermore, the use of the Oura Ring in these studies underscores the growing recognition of wearable technology as a valuable tool in clinical research for its potential to enhance the precision of sleep assessments and, by extension, the validity of research findings in the field of somnology.
