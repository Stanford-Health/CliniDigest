The Fitbit Sense, a commercially available wristband fitness tracker, plays a crucial role in somnology trials by providing a non-invasive, user-friendly method for collecting health and physiological data related to sleep. In the context of multimodal sleep interventions, the device's capabilities are being explored not only for their potential in improving sleep health and mitigating alcohol use disorders among young adults through personalized feedback and coaching [1] but also for their accuracy and reliability in measuring critical sleep parameters. These parameters include the percent of night spent in REM sleep, oxygen desaturation, and the apnea hypopnea index, which are traditionally assessed through in-laboratory polysomnograms and home sleep testing [2]. The inclusion of Fitbit Sense in these trials underscores its significance in advancing sleep research by offering a practical alternative for continuous sleep monitoring, thereby facilitating a deeper understanding of sleep patterns and disorders in naturalistic settings.
