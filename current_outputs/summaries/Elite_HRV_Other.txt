The purpose of employing Elite HRV in clinical trials, such as the one focused on manual therapy in Parkinson's disease [1], extends beyond traditional outcome measures. By integrating Elite HRV, researchers can gain insights into the autonomic nervous system's response to interventions, offering a nuanced understanding of how treatments like manual therapy impact physiological stress and recovery markers. This approach could revolutionize the evaluation of therapeutic effectiveness, particularly in trials aiming to improve motor and non-motor symptoms in chronic conditions [1]. The use of Elite HRV could thus provide a comprehensive assessment tool, enabling a deeper exploration of the interplay between physical interventions and autonomic regulation, potentially guiding more personalized and effective treatment strategies in clinical settings.
