The Apple Watch, while not explicitly mentioned in the provided trials, serves a similar purpose to the health and fitness wristbands and devices used in these studies, such as the Fitbit Charge 5 in trial [1] and the digital tools in trial [5]. In endocrinology trials, such wearable technology can be instrumental in monitoring real-time health metrics, including glucose levels, physical activity, and dietary habits, which are crucial for managing conditions like prediabetes and Type 1 Diabetes. These devices facilitate the collection of continuous, objective data outside the clinical setting, enabling researchers to assess the impact of interventions on metabolic health outcomes more accurately and in real-time.
