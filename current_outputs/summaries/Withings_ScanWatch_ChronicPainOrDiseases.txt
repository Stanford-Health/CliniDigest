The Withings ScanWatch serves a pivotal role in chronic pain or disease trials by facilitating the continuous, real-time monitoring of patient health metrics, thereby offering a nuanced understanding of disease progression and treatment efficacy. In trials focused on conditions like Multiple Sclerosis [1][4], long COVID-related fatigue [2], migraines [3], and chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy [5], the integration of smartwatch data allows for the collection of digital biomarkers that complement traditional clinical assessments. This multimodal approach not only enhances the precision in tracking disease activity and patient-reported outcomes but also supports the identification of subtle changes in health status that may not be readily apparent through conventional monitoring methods. Consequently, the Withings ScanWatch emerges as an indispensable tool in the arsenal of clinical research coordinators, enabling a more dynamic and responsive strategy in the management and study of chronic conditions.
