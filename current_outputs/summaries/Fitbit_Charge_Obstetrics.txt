The purpose of a Fitbit Charge in obstetrics trials is to facilitate the monitoring and enhancement of maternal health through the precise tracking of physical activity, sleep patterns, and overall wellness. In the context of managing gestational weight gain and improving maternal-infant outcomes [1], assessing the impact of increased physical activity on postpartum weight loss and body composition [2], and supporting lifestyle interventions aimed at promoting maternal glucose metabolism [3], the Fitbit Charge serves as a critical tool. It enables the collection of quantitative data essential for evaluating the effectiveness of health interventions tailored to pregnant and postpartum women.
