The purpose of integrating Polar H technology in nephrology trials, as exemplified by the GentleCath™ Air Intermittent Catheter Smartwatch Real Life Pilot Study [1], is multifaceted and primarily aimed at enhancing patient engagement, adherence to treatment protocols, and the accuracy of physiological data collection in real-time. This trial underscores the innovative approach of utilizing smartwatch technology, specifically the Apple™ Smart Watch, to monitor various physiological parameters and fluid management in patients undergoing intermittent self-catheterization [1]. By leveraging the smartwatch's capabilities, such as its microphone for tracking bladder emptying and the Daily Fluid Diary application for monitoring fluid intake and output, the study aims to assess the feasibility and user acceptance of these digital tools in a real-life setting [1]. This approach not only facilitates a more comprehensive understanding of patient behaviors and treatment efficacy but also opens new avenues for personalized patient care and monitoring in nephrology.
