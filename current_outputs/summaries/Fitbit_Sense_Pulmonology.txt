The Fitbit Sense, with its advanced health-tracking features, serves a pivotal role in pulmonology trials, particularly in studies like "Interventions Against Insulin Resistance in Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension" [1]. Its capability to accurately monitor physical activity and physiological parameters can be instrumental in assessing the efficacy of interventions aimed at combating insulin resistance in PAH patients. By providing continuous, real-time data on patients' physical activity levels, the Fitbit Sense can offer invaluable insights into the correlation between the interventions and improvements in the six-minute walk distance, a key endpoint in the trial [1]. This, in turn, aids in evaluating the interventions' impact on patients' functional capacity and overall quality of life, aligning with the trial's primary objective [1].
