The Dexcom G Pro serves a pivotal role in psychiatry trials by facilitating the exploration of the intricate relationship between glucose levels and psychiatric conditions, particularly those associated with eating behaviors and mental health challenges. In the context of eating disorders, the Dexcom G Pro enables precise monitoring of glucose fluctuations, offering insights into the metabolic impacts of conditions like anorexia nervosa and binge eating [1,3]. This continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) technology is instrumental in assessing the efficacy of interventions aimed at stabilizing glucose levels, which may, in turn, influence psychiatric symptoms and treatment outcomes. Furthermore, by providing objective, real-time data, the Dexcom G Pro supports the development of tailored interventions that address the unique metabolic and psychological needs of individuals with psychiatric conditions, thereby enhancing the overall understanding and management of these complex disorders [1,3].
