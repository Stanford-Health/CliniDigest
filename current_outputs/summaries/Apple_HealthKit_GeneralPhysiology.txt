The Apple HealthKit serves as a pivotal tool in general physiology trials by facilitating the collection and analysis of a wide range of health-related data, thereby supporting diverse research objectives aimed at enhancing public health outcomes. Through its integration in studies such as the Apple Hearing Study [2], HealthKit demonstrates its utility in monitoring environmental and headphone sound exposure to assess impacts on hearing health, exemplifying its role in advancing understanding and informing public health policies. Moreover, its application extends to incentivizing physical activity through mHealth interventions, as seen in the incentive-based mHealth application trial [4], where it aids in tracking physical activity and engaging users through personalized goals. Thus, Apple HealthKit emerges as a versatile and effective platform in the realm of physiology trials, enabling comprehensive health monitoring, promoting behavior change, and contributing to the development of targeted health interventions.
