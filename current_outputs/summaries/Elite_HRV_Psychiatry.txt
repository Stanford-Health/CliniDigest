The purpose of Elite HRV in psychiatry trials is to explore its potential as a non-invasive, technology-driven intervention for improving mental health outcomes, particularly in stress and emotional regulation. By incorporating Elite HRV into interventions such as HRV biofeedback training, these trials aim to leverage real-time heart rate variability data to teach participants self-regulation techniques that can mitigate stress, anxiety, and other psychiatric symptoms. For instance, in a study targeting stress reduction among university students and staff, HRV biofeedback is evaluated for its effectiveness in enhancing emotional regulation and inducing positive brain changes [1]. Similarly, in the Bio-HEALTH study, the Elite HRV app is used to facilitate diaphragmatic breathing exercises aimed at improving HRV and managing symptoms of binge-spectrum eating disorders [2]. These trials underscore the potential of Elite HRV as a tool for psychiatric interventions, offering a personalized and accessible approach to mental health care.
