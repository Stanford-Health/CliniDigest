The purpose of a Fitbit Sense in cardiology trials is multifaceted, primarily focusing on enhancing patient engagement, facilitating remote monitoring, and improving physical activity levels among participants with cardiovascular conditions. In the realm of cardiology research, the integration of Fitbit devices serves as a pivotal tool for collecting real-time physiological data, which is crucial for monitoring patient health status outside of clinical settings. For instance, trials like the Young Adult Congenital Heart Disease Physical Activity Lifestyle Study (YACHD-PALS) [5] and its adaptation for adolescent and emerging adult congenital heart disease survivors [8] leverage Fitbit devices to monitor physical activity levels and engage participants in lifestyle interventions aimed at increasing their physical activity. Similarly, the use of Fitbit activity trackers in a pilot study aimed at improving physical activity and quality of life for women with coronary artery disease [6] underscores the device's utility in facilitating patient self-monitoring and goal setting. Furthermore, the My Cardiac Recovery (MyCaRe) pilot RCT [9] and a study identifying the minimum effective dose of a behavioral change intervention for increasing physical activity among individuals on statins [10] highlight the role of Fitbit devices in supporting interactive tracking and self-monitoring, thereby fostering a more personalized and efficient approach to cardiac rehabilitation and recovery. Collectively, these trials demonstrate the critical role of Fitbit Sense in advancing cardiology research by enabling continuous patient monitoring, promoting physical activity, and supporting personalized care interventions.
