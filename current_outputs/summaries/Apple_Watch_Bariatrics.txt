The purpose of an Apple Watch in bariatrics trials, such as the study evaluating the SlimBiotics Probiotic Formula [1], is multifaceted. Primarily, it serves as a tool for continuous, real-time monitoring of participants' physical activity levels and metabolic health indicators, such as heart rate and calories burned. This capability is crucial for accurately assessing the impact of the probiotic formula on weight management and metabolic health outcomes. Furthermore, the Apple Watch facilitates the hybrid trial model [1] by enabling virtual assessments, thereby enhancing participant engagement and compliance through timely reminders and motivational feedback directly related to the study's objectives.
