The Apple Watch, as demonstrated in somnology trials, serves a multifaceted purpose in the exploration and enhancement of sleep quality and the management of sleep-related disorders. In the Atopic Dermatitis With Accelerometry and Polysomnography (ADAP) trial, the Apple Watch is utilized alongside other wrist-worn devices to assess sleep and scratching behaviors in participants with and without Atopic Dermatitis, highlighting its capability to monitor physical activity and sleep patterns in a non-invasive manner [1]. This application underscores the device's potential in providing valuable insights into sleep behaviors and disturbances, which can be pivotal in understanding and managing conditions that affect sleep quality. The versatility of the Apple Watch, capable of tracking a wide array of physiological and activity metrics, positions it as a significant tool in somnology research. Its use in trials reflects an ongoing shift towards integrating wearable technology in clinical research, offering a novel approach to monitoring sleep outside the traditional sleep laboratory setting. This integration not only enhances the granularity and volume of sleep data collected but also contributes to a more patient-centered research approach, allowing for the assessment of sleep in real-life settings. Therefore, the Apple Watch's role in somnology trials extends beyond mere sleep tracking; it represents a convergence of technology and healthcare, promising to refine sleep research methodologies and improve patient outcomes in sleep medicine.
