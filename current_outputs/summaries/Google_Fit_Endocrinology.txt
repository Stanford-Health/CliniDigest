The purpose of Google Fit in endocrinology trials is to enhance the monitoring and management of conditions related to metabolic and hormonal health by leveraging digital health technologies. Specifically, Google Fit can serve as a critical tool in trials like those investigating the effects of interventions on brown adipose tissue thermogenesis in women [1], integrating with neuromodulation therapies for diabetic neuropathy [2], and supporting personalized health and nutrition applications aimed at improving lifestyle factors in individuals with dietary deficiencies or overweight conditions [3]. By facilitating the collection of real-time, comprehensive data on physical activity, dietary intake, and other health metrics, Google Fit can significantly contribute to the understanding of endocrine disorders and the development of targeted interventions, thereby improving patient outcomes and advancing the field of endocrinology.
