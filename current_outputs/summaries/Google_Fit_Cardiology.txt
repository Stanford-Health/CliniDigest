Google Fit, a comprehensive health-tracking platform, plays a pivotal role in cardiology trials by facilitating the monitoring and management of physical activity and heart rate data, which are crucial in assessing cardiovascular health. In the context of the Cardiovascular Disease Risk of Awareness trial [1], Google Fit could serve as an essential tool in the CARDIOREP program by enabling participants to track their daily activities and heart health metrics in real-time. This capability not only aids in raising awareness among participants about their cardiovascular risk factors but also supports the trial's objective to reduce these risks by encouraging lifestyle modifications based on the data collected through the app. By integrating Google Fit into the trial's methodology, researchers can gather large-scale, precise data on physical activity and heart rate, thereby enhancing the trial's effectiveness in identifying and mitigating cardiovascular disease risks [1].
