The Dreem Headband emerges as a pivotal tool in somnology trials, serving multiple purposes that span from enhancing diagnostic accuracy to facilitating innovative treatment approaches in sleep-related disorders. Primarily, its application in the accurate diagnosis of Narcolepsy through continuous 'home' EEG monitoring showcases its potential to rival traditional in-patient polysomnography and Multiple Sleep Latency Tests (MSLT), offering a less restrictive and more patient-friendly diagnostic method [5]. Furthermore, its utility extends to evaluating the efficacy of sleep interventions, such as Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP) treatment in patients with obstructive sleep apnea syndrome, by characterizing sleep parameters in real-life conditions over extended periods [3]. The Dreem Headband's capability for long-term monitoring also supports research into the complex relationship between sleep disturbances and neurological disorders, such as epilepsy, by providing detailed insights into the impact of sleep on seizure susceptibility [4]. Additionally, its use in assessing the neurocognitive outcomes of sleep interventions highlights its role in advancing our understanding of sleep's influence on cognitive health [6]. The Dreem Headband's versatility and validated accuracy position it as an indispensable tool in somnology research, facilitating a deeper understanding of sleep architecture, the efficacy of interventions, and the diagnosis and management of sleep disorders [7,8].
