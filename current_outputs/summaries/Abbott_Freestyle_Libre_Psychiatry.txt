The Abbott Freestyle Libre, a continuous glucose monitoring system, plays a pivotal role in psychiatry trials, particularly in studies exploring the intersection of physical chronic conditions and mental health, such as type 1 diabetes and its psychological implications [1]. In the context of the REACHOUT Mental Health Support Mobile App trial, the Freestyle Libre could be instrumental in providing real-time glucose monitoring for participants, thereby offering a comprehensive understanding of how glucose levels interact with mental health states in adults with type 1 diabetes [1]. This integration of physiological data with psychiatric evaluations can enhance the trial's ability to assess the effectiveness of peer-led mental health support programs. By monitoring glucose fluctuations alongside mental health interventions, researchers can gain insights into the bidirectional relationship between glycemic control and mental well-being, potentially leading to more personalized and effective treatment strategies for individuals with type 1 diabetes [1].
