The Apple HealthKit serves as a pivotal tool in psychiatry trials by facilitating the integration of personalized health data to support behavior change interventions aimed at improving mental health outcomes and managing non-communicable diseases. Through its ability to collect and analyze user health data, HealthKit enables the development of tailored interventions that address individual lifestyle factors critical to mental health, such as physical activity, stress, and substance use [1].
