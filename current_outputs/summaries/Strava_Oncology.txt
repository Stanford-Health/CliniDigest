Strava, traditionally known for its role in tracking physical activity and fostering a community among athletes, is venturing into the realm of oncology trials with a novel approach. Specifically, its application in the field of oncology is being explored through its potential to contribute to preventive cancer care, as evidenced by a trial aiming to mitigate melanoma risk by delivering sun safety advice to users engaged in outdoor activities [3]. This innovative use of Strava's technology underscores a broader trend in clinical research towards leveraging digital health tools not only for monitoring physical activity but also for implementing preventive health strategies. By utilizing Strava's open-source API to predict and intervene in high-risk behaviors in real-time, this trial exemplifies how mobile technology can be repurposed to support public health initiatives, particularly in the context of cancer prevention and awareness.
