LQTS is associated with a risk of syncope or sudden death from ventricular arrhythmia. The increase in the duration of the corrected QT interval and / or changes in the morphology of the T wave on the electrocardiogram are markers of an increased risk of sudden death and syncope. Recently, a personal portable 6-lead device (DI, DII, DIII, aVF, aVL and aVR) connected to the patient's smartphone has entered the market (KARDIA MOBILE 6L, AliveCor, Mountain View, CALIFORNIA, USA). The APPLE WATCH Series 6 (Apple, Cupertino, CA, USA) can also record an ECG. If the device is designed to record a single lead (DI), several works have shown that it is possible to record 9 leads (DI, DII, DIII, V1, V2, V3, V4, V5 and V6) by moving simply the device (Spaccarotella CAS et al. JAMA Cardiology 2020). These devices were originally designed to screen for atrial fibrillation, but they produce accurate 6- and 9-lead ECGs and could potentially allow ambulatory ECG monitoring of patients with LQTS."

            "Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common arrhythmia affecting 1.3 million people in the UK. AF causes an irregular and fast heartbeat, which makes the heart pump poorly. As a result, blood clots may form inside the heart and, if they travel to the brain, can lead to an AF-related stroke. Patients with AF have a risk of stroke five-times higher than patients with normal rhythm. Anticoagulants make the blood less likely to clot and, thus, reduce the chances of an AF-related stroke. For most people, once anticoagulation is started it must be taken for the rest of their lives irrespective of the amount of AF someone has. However, anticoagulants make patients more prone to bleeding. New studies have reported a lower stroke risk in patients with short and infrequent AF episodes. If there are long time gaps in between AF episodes, short periods of anticoagulation around the time of AF may be enough to avoid clots from forming and reducing the overall risk of bleeding. To use anticoagulants only when needed will require an accurate and reliable way to detect AF when it occurs and alert patients. New technologies, such as small heart monitors placed under the skin, watches and rings, can track the heart rhythm continuously and send real-time alerts to patients via mobile phone message if AF is detected. The purpose of this study is to investigate if implantable cardiac monitors (LINQ II) and wearable devices (Apple Watch and CART-I ring) can detect AF episodes, send real-time alerts to patients and who will respond to these alerts within a short timeframe. The investigators will recruit 50 patients and follow them for six months. All participants will receive a LINQ II and a wearable device."

            "Implantable devices increase the detection of silent atrial fibrillation in high-risk populations, being a useful tool in the early diagnosis of these patients, allowing monitoring for a longer time. Currently, these devices can be used for monitoring and possible early diagnosis of abnormalities in order to prevent health complications and bring about better outcomes, as well as monitor the user's progress and thus prevent more serious developments. Objective: to analyze, in patients with cardiovascular disease, the electrocardiographic aspects detected from the device in comparison to the conventional electrocardiogram, identifying aspects of similarity between the tracings obtained and automatic diagnostic accuracy by the device and by the visual assessment of the tracing. Method: a cross-sectional observational study of diagnostic accuracy will be carried out at the University Hospital of the Federal University of Piaui. The following parameters were considered: significance level of 95%, test power of 80%, value of the disease diagnosis rate of 84%, area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 94% and an equal proportion of the number of positive and negative cases. The minimum sample size consisted of 100 patients, and an additional 10% will be added to compensate for possible losses. A total of 110 patients will be invited to participate in the study. Patients aged \u2265 18 years will be included, with the presence of one or more diagnoses below: systemic arterial hypertension, heart failure, valvular disease, coronary atherosclerotic disease, myocardial infarction, endocarditis, myocarditis, diabetes, cardiac arrhythmias and patients with cardiac pace or implantable automatic defibrillator. The variables analyzed will be: clinical-demographic data of the patients, including age, sex, race, socioeconomic profile; comorbidities and electrocardiographic findings as measured by the clock and conventional ECG. The data will be analyzed comparatively between the groups: 1 = EKG on the clock; 2 = 12-lead conventional EKG and DI (single lead). The primary outcome will be the positive diagnostic correlation of the data obtained in group 1 in relation to group 2. Secondary outcomes: successful measurement of the electrocardiographic record by the clock; diagnostic accuracy of atrial fibrillation and other heart rhythm disorders."

In the following months, the disease developed into a pandemic, which is currently an immense international challenge. So far, there is little scientific evidence on risk stratification, especially on the prognostic value of biomarkers (laboratory-chemical, clinical and digital) with regard to clinical deterioration of patients with COVID-19. Further scientific studies are needed to establish optimal risk stratification and early detection of clinical deterioration. In this study, the investigators aim to observe patients with COVID-19 via SmartWatches on top of their clinical routine. The investigators aim to determine, whether the addition of SmartWatches enhances risk stratification, early detection of complications and prognostics in patients with COVID-19, who have cardiovascular diseases or receive medication with arrhythmogenic risk."

To date, all PTSD assessments are retrospective; individuals with PTSD are asked to recount and report their symptoms over the past weeks or months. Such assessment procedures are negatively impacted by individuals' abilities to accurately recall information. Moreover, retrospective assessments provide little information about how symptoms are experienced in the moment and how these experiences then lead to other behaviors. The proposed project addresses these limitations by assessing PTSD symptoms and associated biological markers (e.g., sleep, heart rate, heart rate variability) in real-time by asking subjects to wear a smart device and complete brief surveys. Data will be collected from 50 individuals with PTSD and 20 healthy controls to help us better understand individuals' real-time experience with PTSD and lay the foundation to develop algorithms for possible in-the-moment interventions in the future."

People with T1D need insulin shots because their body does not make insulin. Insulin lowers blood sugar levels. When blood sugar levels are too high or too low it causes medical problems. Youth with T1D can really impact their own health if they follow their T1D treatment plan. However, even with the help of doctors, nurses, and family, most adolescents find it hard to follow their diabetes plan close enough to meet their A1C goal. It is very common for adolescents to forget to give an insulin bolus for meals. When insulin doses are missed, there is a greater chance for poor blood sugar control. When adolescents follow their diabetes plan closely, they have better blood sugar control and overall health. Two behavioral economic interventions will be evaluated. COIN2DOSE (Cash-Only INcentive to promote mealtime insulin DOSE Engagement) and LOAN2DOSE (Behavioral Economic concept that uses an economic loss aversion approach to promote insulin dose engagement in adolescents with Type 1 Diabetes). These programs were designed to improve blood sugar control by decreasing the number of missed mealtime boluses. For COIN2DOSE, we will offer the opportunity for youth to earn a bonus reimbursement during which they achieve at least 5 days of 3 mealtime insulin boluses. Finally, we will pay youth up for sharing their insulin use data at least two times per week with the study team during the three-month treatment phase. For LOAN2DOSE, the participants will start with a monetary \"balance\" and will keep it if they bolus as instructed - at least 5 days of 3 mealtime insulin boluses. If they do not do this, their balance will decrease throughout the study."

There is an increased risk of glucose abnormalities with cycled PN, which can be harmful to infant growth and brain health. Continuous glucose monitors (CGM) will be used to measure interstitial glucose levels (in the tissue under the skin), which are similar to blood glucose levels. CGM is a small, minimally-invasive sensor worn on the thigh, which gives a glucose measurement every 5 minutes, and can help us understand changes in blood sugar levels without having to do a blood draw or fingerstick. CGM will be used during PN cycling for up to 30 days or until hospital discharge. CGM data will be hidden from the clinical team, there will be no change to routine clinical care. This study may help us understand how cycled PN affects glucose levels in infants with intestinal failure, which may help other children treated with cycled PN in the future."

            "Glucose control during labor is important for both fetus and mother. During labor and delivery, the goal is to maintain the sugars in the normal range as safely as possible as increased blood sugars 4-6 h prior to delivery leads to increased rates of hypoglycemia in the neonate. Neonatal hypoglycemia is a risk for the offspring of pregnant women with diabetes and occurs when fetal pancreatic hyperplasia is acutely stimulated by a high fetal glucose level derived from maternal hyperglycemia during labor. The maternal blood glucose level during delivery is a predictor of the neonatal blood glucose level. Modern continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) systems can capture the direction and magnitude of short-lived changes in interstitial glucose levels and are therefore useful for assessing glucose variability more accurately than self-monitoring blood glucose (SMBG) measurements. Indeed, it has already been demonstrated that intermittent blood glucose monitoring underestimates the number of hyperglycemic events, because blood glucose excursions can peak at different times of day. CGMs can help identify glycemic patterns in pregnancy, obtain and maintain glucose targets, and reduce hypoglycemia. Strict glycemic control during labor and delivery may reduce the risk of neonatal hypoglycemia. Two groups have reported on the use of CGM in type 1 diabetics during labor in small pilot studies. Another study looked at effects of maternal glucose levels in insulin-treated women during labor and delivery (2 to 8 h before birth) and resultant neonatal hypoglycemia. The researchers found that maternal hyperglycemia before delivery was correlated with neonatal hypoglycemia. Although more studies are needed, CGM use has promise as a therapy to improve outcomes in pregnancies associated with diabetes. In this study, the investigators plan to explore whether the use of blinded glucose monitoring during labor, delivery, and early postpartum supplementary to normally monitored plasma glucose measurements in women with gestational diabetes (GDM) would provide useful information to improve glycemia during labor in this diabetic population. All CGM data will be masked and therefore not available to participants, clinicians, or researchers at the time of delivery. Participants otherwise will receive standard clinical care. The blinded glucose monitoring data on glycemia throughout labor and post-delivery will be retrospectively assessed."

Patients with end stage renal disease (ESRD) who are on intermittent hemodialysis (iHD) or peritoneal dialysis (PD) undergo fluid shifts between the interstitial fluid and intravascular space during dialysis treatments.These fluid shifts, uremia, acidosis, and volume overload (increase in interstitial fluid volume due to ESRD) have the potential to impact the performance of the most advanced and commercially available CGMs; however, use of CGM in these patients has not yet been studied.Use of CGM, and potentially hybrid closed loop insulin delivery systems that are dependent on accurate continuous glucose monitoring, has the potential to improve glucose control and quality of life in these patients (7).

This hormone is involved in the body's response to low blood glucose (hypoglycaemia). It works by releasing glucose stores from the liver to bring the blood glucose back to normal. This defect therefore increases the risk of severe hypoglycaemia. The reason for this Glucagon defect in people with Type 1 diabetes is currently unknown. This study aims to look at the Glucagon response to hypoglycaemia in 24 people with type 1 diabetes to ascertain whether tight blood glucose control over a period of time improves this response. The investigators aim to achieve good blood glucose control using new generation Automated Insulin Delivery systems (AIDs). This system is made of: an insulin pump, a continuous glucose monitor (CGM) and an algorithm that allows adjustment of insulin delivery based on the blood glucose readings from the CGM. This is the most up to date technology that there is in the management of type 1 diabetes. However, people using this technology often still have problems with high blood glucose after eating. To ensure a very good blood glucose control participants will also follow a low carbohydrate diet to prevent this blood glucose rise after meals. The Glucagon response to low blood glucose will be measured at zero and eight months using the hyperinsulinaemic hypoglycaemic clamp technique."

Since the initial discovery of ACS for neonatal benefit in 1972, more than 40 randomized controlled trials have been performed evaluating its efficacy. However, none of these trials have included women with T2DM, and there is limited data among women with gestational diabetes. While ACS have been shown to reduce neonatal morbidity associated with PTB in non-diabetic women, the side effects of ACS (maternal hyperglycemia and fetal hyperinsulinemia) may mitigate the neonatal benefit of ACS in women with diabetes. Before neonatal benefit of ACS can be evaluated in this population, the first step is to optimize maternal glycemic control after ACS. Previous studies evaluating maternal hyperglycemia after ACS have been limited by small sample size, retrospective study design, or insufficient glucose data. Use of continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) in a randomized clinical trial provides a unique opportunity to overcome these challenges. Our long-term goal is to improve maternal and child health among women with diabetes as an independently funded clinical researcher. The research objectives of this proposal are to test the efficacy of three treatment strategies at achieving maternal glycemic control after ACS and evaluate the association between maternal glycemic control and neonatal outcomes. Our central hypothesis is that treatment with a continuous insulin infusion will improve maternal glycemic control, which is key to improving neonatal outcomes, but at the cost of less patient satisfaction and more health resource utilization. This hypothesis will be tested by pursuing the following specific aims: 1) Test the efficacy of three treatment strategies (addition of sliding scale insulin, up-titration of home insulin, and continuous insulin infusion) at achieving maternal glycemic control after ACS and 2) Quantify the association between maternal glycemic control after ACS and neonatal morbidity. Completion of these aims will determine the optimal strategy to achieve maternal glycemic control after ACS and inform a larger, multicenter trial to improve neonatal outcomes among women with diabetes and threatened PTB."

Previous randomized trials of intensive insulin therapy in the hospital setting resulted in excessive hypoglycemia. Current ADA guidelines (glucose 140-180 mg/dL) are by consensus with the upper bound defined by observational data and the lower bound by safety concerns. None of the previous studies of intensive glucose management used CGM technology. Whether near normal glucose levels can be achieved without increasing hypoglycemia among hospitalized patients with diabetes with the advent of CGM technology is not known. There are clear associations between hyperglycemia and poor outcomes in patients with diabetes hospitalized with infection, including COVID-19. The COVID-19 pandemic has increased the urgency to definitively answer the question of whether glucose lowering below 140-180 mg/dL can be achieved without increasing hypoglycemia. If this proposed study demonstrates intensive management of glucose to a target of 90 to 130 mg/dL without hypoglycemia is achievable in the inpatient setting with CGM technology, a larger study could then be performed to evaluate whether there is clinical benefit including a reduction in morbidity and mortality. The primary study hypothesis is that glucose management with CGM can achieve a mean glucose of 90-130 mg/dL without increasing hypoglycemia compared with standard care with a glucose target of 140-180 mg/dL. Individuals with diabetes who are hospitalized (non-ICU) for an eligible condition will be randomly assigned to receive standard therapy (glucose target 140-180 mg/dL per ADA guidelines) or intensive therapy (glucose target 90-130 mg/dL and CGM used for monitoring). Real-time CGM will be used in the Intensive Target Group and masked CGM will be used in the Standard Target Group. The co-primary outcomes, assessed via a hierarchical approach, include a treatment group comparison of mean glucose (superiority) followed by a non-inferiority comparison of time <54 mg/dL measured with CGM."

The interest of perioperative cerebral monitoring and in particular electroencephalography (EEG) to reduce neurological and cognitive damage in surgery has been the subject of abundant research and corresponds to a crucial issue. From the literature and preliminary results obtained in our clinical research unit, it appears that there is also a relationship between certain characteristics of the peroperative EEG (signal strength and burst suppression) and the occurrence of postoperative cognitive dysfunction (PCOD). In this context, quantitative analysis of the preoperative sleep EEG and the EEG obtained during general anesthesia could allow the identification of a simple to use biomarker of susceptibility or fragility. To our knowledge, there is no preoperative evaluation strategy using EEG analysis to detect a predisposition to POCD. The main goal of this observational clinical study is to extend the traditional use of per-operative EEG with pre-operative and post-operative sleep EEG for the detection and prediction of early post-operative cognitive dysfunction."

This is related to the cost of performing these studies with repeated recordings in the laboratory and to the acceptability by patients to perform multiple nights of recordings. Investigators currently have powerful and reliable methods allowing us to carry out nights at home in the patient's ecosystem, in real-life conditions. The characterization of sleep parameters by these methods is equivalent to a polysomnographic recording. These technological innovations will allow us to characterize sleep before the initiation of CPAP treatment during several nights performed at home. Investigators will then be able to characterize the kinetics and stability of the improvement of sleep parameters in patients with obstructive sleep apnea syndrome in whom continuous positive airway pressure is initiated. These data will be original and will serve as exploratory data to judge whether the objective improvement of sleep parameters in the first weeks of treatment is associated with improvement in sleepiness, quality of life, and compliance with treatment."

Though non-motor features have been recognized for centuries, only recently has the prevalence and impact of non-motor symptoms become the focus of intense study. Disturbances of sleep are among the most common non-motor manifestations of PD; approximately two-thirds of PD patients experience sleep dysfunction of some kind. Given that sleep contributes to the regulation of many physiological processes, sleep disturbance has a significant impact on quality of life in PD, and places high strain on caregivers. Though numerous symptomatic therapies exist, the treatment of sleep disorders in PD is limited by a lack of adequately powered, randomized studies providing high quality evidence. Although deep brain stimulation (DBS) is primarily used to treat PD motor symptoms and reduce the need for dopaminergic medications, several studies have shown that DBS provides benefit for non-motor symptoms, including sleep disturbance. Few studies have used an objective measure to assess the impact of DBS on sleep in PD, and none have done so by studying sleep in the home environment. Existing studies have largely been limited to a single night of sleep recording in a sleep lab. Furthermore, no studies have assessed sleep both on and off medication, before and after DBS implantation. This study will enroll patients undergoing evaluation for DBS implantation. Sleep will be assessed before DBS implantation, both while patients continue their usual medication regimen and while withholding medications. After DBS implantation and programming, sleep will again be assessed with stimulation on, both while continuing medications and subsequently while withholding medications."

Actually, there is no study observing the effect of this new stimulation method on populations with neurodegenerative pathologies, in particular in AD for which this technique could potentially become a therapeutic option.

On duty or in training, mountain troops, paratroopers or aircrew are regularly exposed to altitude. The effects of altitude on humans occur gradually from 1500 m and depend on both the duration of exposure and the altitude level. Cognitive disorders can occur from 3500 m (threshold of disorders) but there is a very large inter-individual variability. The countermeasure to altitude hypoxia is oxygen but its use is not systematic between 3000 and 4000 m. Its use depends on the duration of exposure, without clearly established standards. Incapacitating effects on the operational capacity and health of soldiers can therefore occur as early as 3500 m. In operations or during training, altitude exposure is often associated with a significant sleep debt (particularly during night or early morning missions), jet lag or precarious rest conditions in overseas operations. These sleep restrictions promote the degradation of mental performance with effects similar to those observed in hypoxia. The combination of these constraints induces a physiological stress which can favour alterations in mental performance, an increase in incapacity, intolerance to altitude or the occurrence of altitude-related pathologies in military personnel. This could occur in particular in the operational zone around the threshold of disorders (3500 m) where the indication of oxygen is discussed. The objective of this study is to assess the impact of acute sleep restriction on hypoxia tolerance."

Young adults with type 1 diabetes, have additional interference with fear, control and management of hypo/hyperglycemia management, alarms from their devices, which delay bedtime, disrupt sleep and generate multiple awakenings and difficulty returning to sleep. Sleep disturbance is correlated with blood glucose variability as recently demonstrated by a coupled analysis of sleep and glucose level collected by Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM). In this study, higher glucose variability predicted impaired sleep at the individual level. Automated insulin infusion has shown impressive results in clinical and real-life studies, with more than 90% of patients achieving good glycemic control. Il seems to improve sleep quality in subjects after 4 weeks in hybrid closed-loop, self-administered studies compared to a control group. The main objective of our study is to measure the positive influence of a better glycemic control on the different sleep parameters in subjects with type 1 diabetes at the time of the passage in hybrid closed-loop and in comparison to an identical period in open-loop."

According to a part of the scientific community, replicative traumatic nightmares represent PTSD's basis mechanism. Traumatic nightmares generate disabling symptoms such as anxiety reactions, while maintaining the symptoms by depriving the individual of good quality sleep. Traumatic nightmares may thus be a sign of PTSD seriousness and chronicity, although their physiological basis remain poorly known. In the military population, which is highly exposed to psychological traumatism, PTSD prevalence is very high and is associated with severe intensity patterns, a very high frequency of replicative nightmares and a low response to conventional therapies."

            "Long-term pain affects one-third of the United Kingdom population and can be very disabling. People experiencing long-term pain often suffer from disturbed sleep because of their pain symptoms, and disturbed sleep can then make their pain symptoms worse. Managing long-term pain is also very costly to the National Health Service. The most common treatment is prescribed medicines, but these do not always work and can have serious side-effects for some patients. The investigators have been developing an alternative approach for treating long-term pain. This approach uses simple non-invasive tools to promote some kinds of brain activity over others. It involves patients using headphones to listen to some specific sounds, or a headset with lights flashing at particular frequencies. The studies undertaken so far seem to show that doing this can change how the brain responds to pain. It potentially offers an inexpensive yet effective way of reducing pain and improving sleep for patients with long-term pain. There are a few small studies that support this approach and more work is needed. In a recent study the investigators found that these tools can be reliably used in home settings and there were some indications that they improved symptoms. However, sleep was only measured with sleep diary and movement detection, there was no direct measurement of whether the stimulation frequencies were resulting in the desired brainwave changes. Finally, the benefit to symptoms may have been the result of other factors, such as the passage of time or placebo effect. Therefore this study extends the experiment, adding more accurate sleep monitoring which includes monitoring electrical activity in the brain (EEG), as well as providing rhythmic and non-rhythmic stimulation in a randomised order. The aim is to further test the effect of these home-based tools with individuals with long-term pain, in a more rigorous way. Up to 30 participants with long-term pain and pain-related sleep disturbance will use the tools for 30 minutes at bed time every day for 4 weeks (2 weeks with one type of stimulation, 2 weeks with another type). The changes in participants' pain, sleep, brainwave frequencies, fatigue and mood will be measured. These findings will inform the planning and design of a future much larger study to test this technology, if this is justified by the results."

Pain management programmes are the recommended treatment for chronic pain, however a number of barriers to their widespread implementation have been identified including geographical distance from speciality programmes, functional disability limiting the mobility of people with CP and economic limitations(1). eHealth interventions have the potential to address a number of these barriers and recent reviews have reported reductions in pain(2), improved knowledge and understanding about chronic pain and chronic pain management, improved function(3) and improvements in quality of life(4) following eHealth interventions. The intervention in this study will be delivered online. Participants will be randomly allocated to a combined MBSR and exercise programme (Group A) or an online self-management guide (Group B). Group A will take part in an 8 week live online weekly mindfulness sessions based on the Mindfulness Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) programme facilitated by a qualified mindfulness teacher, in addition to a supervised exercise classes led by a Physiotherapist. Group B will receive access to an 8 week online self-management guide containing 8 self-directed guides, which will be made available to participants biweekly. Outcomes of feasibility and acceptability will be investigated in addition to a preliminary examination of between group clinical effects at baseline immediately post intervention and at a three month follow up, using validated patient reported outcome measures. In addition all participants will wear a Fitbit activity monitor for the duration of the eight-week interventions to capture activity measures. A qualitative study will also be conducted to gather participants' perceptions of the programme and its usefulness"

It is hypothesized that this combination will lead to significant favorable changes in objectively measured PA and SB, and that such changes will be more likely to be sustained over 6-month follow-up. This study aims to recruit 150 healthy East Asian adults in Hong Kong. At baseline, participants will be invited to visit the research laboratory for measurement of a series of variables including height, body weight, blood pressure and grip strength. Participants will also be invited to complete a set of questionnaires to assess their self-reported PA and SB, fruit and vegetable consumption, smoking status and psychological variables. Blood samples will be collected to analyze key diabetes and cardiovascular disease biochemical markers as well as their estimated genetic risk of T2D. Each individual's unique genetic risk for T2D will be estimated on the basis of established genetic variants associated with T2D specifically for East Asians. Each participant will be asked to wear a Fitbit Charge 4 tracker, an objective activity monitoring device, throughout the entire trial. Participants will be randomly allocated into 3 groups: 1 control and 2 intervention groups. A control group will receive an e-leaflet containing general lifestyle advice for prevention of T2D. An intervention group will receive an estimated genetic risk of T2D, in addition to the e-leaflet. The other intervention group will have a Fitbit step goal set 10% higher than their baseline step count and use prompt functions of the Fitbit tracker, in addition to the genetic risk estimate and e-leaflet. Activity data from the Fitbit will be collected at 4-week post-intervention; information about lifestyle and psychological variables will be assessed through the questionnaires at both immediate and 4-week post-intervention. To determine the longer-term effect of the intervention, participants will be asked to visit the research laboratory 6 months after the intervention to repeat the same set of assessments as baseline, except the blood samples collected at 6-month follow-up are used only to analyze cardiometabolic risk profiles (not genetic risk). Activity levels will also be objectively measured using the Fitbit for 4 weeks."

Physical activity (PA) is the second largest predictor of stroke and the cornerstone of secondary prevention therapies. Adaptive interventions involve sequential treatments responsive to individuals' performance. Despite guidelines to adapt PA to individuals' needs, there is no evidence on the empirical development of adaptive PA interventions post-stroke. The evidence is dominated by standard trial designs, used to evaluate non-adaptive PA interventions. This trial will make original contributions to the literature by designing a first-in-class adaptive PA intervention using an innovative experimental design. This design will permit the delivery of optimal sequences of treatments to increase PA for individuals. Furthermore, by developing a user-informed smartphone application, this feasibility trial will lead to the design and evaluation of a highly-scalable definitive intervention to reduce the risk of recurrent stroke. Aim To use a Sequential Multiple-Assignment Randomised Trial (SMART) design to develop an adaptive, user-informed mobile health (mHealth) intervention to improve PA post-stroke. Subsequently this adaptive intervention will be evaluated against a treatment-as-usual control using a standard trial design in a definitive trial. Methods A co-design process was used to develop the technology platform for intervention delivery. There are two components which target increased PA in the current intervention: Structured Exercise and Lifestyle PA. The SMART will determine what sequence and/or combination of these intervention components produces the greatest increase in physical activity as measured by average daily step count. The primary outcome will be PA (steps/day), with clear feasibility and secondary clinical and cost outcomes. A SMART design will be used to evaluate the optimum adaptive PA intervention among people post-mild-to-moderate stroke."

The first-line KOA management is nonsurgical care, with education and exercise therapy as key elements. Nevertheless, treatment effects of exercise therapy and behavioral pain management on improvements in pain, function and quality of life are small to moderate at best. This shows that there is an urgent need for better KOA care. The innovative solution may lie in thinking beyond joints, by targeting KOA subgroups through comorbidity-specific interventions, which fits well in the global move towards precision medicine. With a prevalence rate up to 50%, the presence of insomnia symptoms is a highly prevalent KOA comorbidity, contributing to symptom severity. If left untreated, it represents a barrier for effective conservative management. Since insomnia is nowadays hardly addressed in the often joint-targeted KOA care, the scientific objectives of the study are to assess 1) if cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) integrated in best-evidence usual care, consisting of education and exercise therapy, (CBTi-UC) is more effective than best-evidence usual care alone (UC), i.e. education and exercise therapy, at 6 months follow-up in improving clinical outcomes and 2) if CBTi-UC is more cost-effective than UC in KOA patients with comorbid insomnia."

Interventions to promote physical activity and sleep that use commercial activity trackers may be useful non-pharmacological approaches to managing individual health; however, limited evidence exists on their use to improve physical activity in elderly patients with multimorbidity. This study aims to measure the effects of behavioral change techniques (BCTs) delivered by a wearable device on physical activity (PA) and quality of sleep (QS) in elderly patients with multimorbidity. The investigators designed an open-label randomized controlled trial with participants recruited through primary care and a specialist outpatient clinic. Participants must be more than 65 years old, have multimorbidity, and have access to smartphones. All eligible participants will receive PA promotion content and will be randomly assigned to wear a smartwatch. The primary outcome will be the participants' PA measurement at six months using the IPAQ-SF. Secondary outcomes will include changes in the participants' frailty status, biometric measurements, quality of life, and biopsychosocial assessments. A sample size of 40 participants per arm was calculated to detect group differences, with 50 participants recruited and randomized into each arm. This study aims to contribute to a better understanding of PA patterns and the impact of smartwatch-based PA interventions in patients with multimorbidity. The trial's findings are expected to improve our understanding of how physical activity patterns, patient-reported outcomes (PROMs), and healthcare resource utilization are linked in patients with multiple medical conditions. The study will use a registry for locally developed PROMs and data from the participants' medical records to determine how wearable data and medical information data can be used to predict PROMs and unplanned hospital admissions."

The eCAN JA explores the role of telemedicine tools (i.e. TC & TM) in clinical trials focusing on tele-rehabilitation and tele-psychological support in different populations of cancer patients in 10 European countries. The pilots will be conducted among 354 patients affected by breast (BC, pilot 1a), head & neck (H&N, pilot 1b) and advanced (pilot 2) cancers. The main aim is to assess the effect of TC and TM program focused on rehabilitation and psychological support for cancer patients on patient reported outcomes measures (PROMs) in three pilots compare to usual care. Patients will be randomly assigned either to the intervention or control groups using a 1:1 ratio. Patients in the intervention group will receive weekly TC of 30 minutes during 8 weeks through the secure Edumeet platform. In pilot 1, tele-rehabilitation training will be performed by a remote physiotherapist and will consist of a series of rehabilitation exercises. In pilot 2, tele-psychological support will be performed by a remote psychologist and will consist of techniques for managing emotions and stress. In the intervention group, patients will also have the possibility to wear a smartwatch to automatically collect physical parameters. Patients in the control group will receive usual care. PROMs (i.e. quality of life, distress and pain) and physical parameters (i.e. physical activity, sleep quality and heart rate) will be monitored by a dedicated telemonitoring systems. A secure web platform will provide dashboard to clinicians for decision support. Patients' experience and costs data will be also collected. The results of the eCAN project will improve our knowledge on benefits and risks for TC and TM in cancer patients care."

Different professional societies, including the German Society of Pneumology and the European Respiratory Society, recommend rehabilitation intervention to reduce the sequelae of COVID-19. However, from the perspective of science and practice, there are relevant areas that have been insufficiently investigated and are essential for the treatment success of post/long COVID patients: - Differentiation of rehabilitation effects from natural recovery after COVID-19. - Lack of personalized and symptom-based treatment approaches that can address the heterogeneity of symptoms in post/long COVID - Lack of uniform, high-quality rehabilitation standards in post-/long-COVID. Therefore, post-COVID patients will be recruited at several post-COVID practices around Germany and randomized to receive (A) a rehabilitation program or (B) usual care. The primary objective of this randomized controlled trial (RCT) is to investigate whether a 3-week symptom-oriented, inpatient, multidisciplinary rehabilitation intervention, whose content focus is standardized according to cluster assignment (fatigue, cognition, soma), has a positive effect on the quality of life (primary outcome) in post-COVID syndrome patients compared to a usual care group (standard outpatient care). All study participants will be provided with a continuous telemonitoring system (SaniQ app) throughout the study period. After the interventional phase, there will be a 3 months follow-up assessment to evaluate the maintenance effects of COVID rehabilitation."

Participants randomized to standard care will receive exercise and nutrition resources as well as a Garmin watch. Participants in the experimental groups will receive standard care, plus a 12-week multidisciplinary app-based personalized program involving 12 weeks of exercise programming and 10-weeks of nutrition programming. Participants in study group 3 will receive additional one-on-one care. The Research Ethics Board at the University of Alberta has approved this study. The protocol will measure patient-related outcome measures including physical function, quality of life, social isolation, and anxiety, as well as measures of acceptability and cost. 216 participants will take part in this study (n=72 per arm). Analyses: fitness testing and patient-reported outcomes will be administered before and after the intervention. Fitness and patient-reported outcomes will be compared using linear mixed models with random effects. App acceptability will be compared between groups using Chi-Square."

It is associated with maternal and fetal morbidity and the risk is correlated to the patient's degree of glucose control which can be achieved through a change in lifestyle or medication. Several studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of mobile apps in improving obstetric outcomes in GDM. In addition, the LUMEN device is a breathing device that produces dietary and exercise recommendations based on CO2 levels and improves metabolic parameters in patients with type 2 diabetes. No work has been done on its effectiveness in treating GDM. Aims of the study: Comparison of metabolic outcomes in women with gestational diabetes, with or without the use of LUMEN app. Design: This will be an open label parallel group 1:1 randomized-controlled trial Methods: the investigators will recruit women diagnosed with GDM. The women will be randomized to the intervention arm that will use the LUMEN device and app or to the control arm that will use a free mobile tracking app. The women will be required to monitor their blood sugar levels daily and to have GDM follow-up in the feto-maternal outpatient clinic, as is customary in GDM. After the birth, the maternal and neonatal outcome will be recorded. Based on past research data, a recruitment of 170 is needed to demonstrate a 16.7% decrease in insulin use to balance diabetes, with \u03b1 = 0.05 and \u03b2 = 80."

Objective: This study aimed to compare the effectiveness of a gamified and behavior change technique-based mobile app, PuzzleWalk, versus a commercially available app, Google Fit, on increasing PA and reducing sedentary time as an adjunct anxiety treatment for this population. Methods: A total of 24 adults with ASD were assigned to either the PuzzleWalk or Google Fit group for 5 weeks using a covariate-adaptive randomization design. PA and anxiety were assessed over 7 days at 3 different data collection periods (ie, baseline, intervention start, and intervention end) using triaxial accelerometers and the Beck Anxiety Inventory. Group differences in outcome variables were assessed using repeated-measures analysis of covariance, adjusting for age, sex, and BMI."

However, existing interventions, which typically prescribe uniform PA goals across participants, are limited by their insensitivity to changing individual needs and circumstances over time. An alternative approach is to continuously adjust goal difficulty to match fluctuations in individual performance, or adaptive goal-setting (AGS), which evidence suggests may more effective for increasing PA than non-adaptive approaches. Still, no prior studies have examined the psychological mechanisms targeted by AGS, which limits the ability to further refine and disseminate this technique. In this exploratory study, several candidate mechanisms of AGS (expectancy beliefs about goals, perceived value of goals, affective appraisal of goals, implicit attitudes towards exercise) will be examined. Adult participants interested in increasing their level of physical activity (N = 36) will be randomized to receive 6 weeks of either adaptive goal-setting (AGS) or non-adaptive, static goal-setting (SGS) as part of a remote, low-intensity PA intervention. The primary aim of the study will be to evaluate the hypothesis that AGS, as compared to SGS, results in greater increases over time to four hypothesized psychological mechanisms. The secondary aim will be to evaluate whether post-intervention increases to any among these three mechanisms mediate the relationship between intervention type (AGS vs. SGS) and increases to PA over the course of the intervention."

            "Patients with cancer in developing countries face considerable challenges in obtaining access to care due to a lack of human resources and infrastructure. This is particularly pressing for vulnerable populations such as older adults. In this setting, many patients receiving chemotherapy are unable to report the presence of toxicities, and adverse events can go unnoticed for considerable amounts of time. The goal of this study is to assess the accuracy of an objective patient-centered measure of physical function (the number of steps taken per day measured using an accelerometer-equipped smartphone) for the remote detection of chemotherapy toxicity in older adults. This study builds on a pilot trial showing that monitoring older patients remotely utilizing an accelerometer-equipped smartphone is feasible and acceptable, and that a decline in the number of steps detected using the device can be an early sign of chemotherapy toxicity. The hypothesis of this study is that a decline in the number daily steps from a prechemotherapy baseline, measured using an accelerometer-equipped smartphone, will be accurate for detecting chemotherapy toxicity in older adults with cancer. This study will evaluate the ability of a patient-centered measure (a decline in the number of daily steps compared with a pre-chemotherapy baseline) to identify the presence of clinically-significant chemotherapy-related toxicity in Mexican older adults with cancer starting first line chemotherapy. Patients will be provided with an accelerometer-equipped smartphone with an installed pedometer application. Baseline steps per day will be obtained and recorded before starting chemotherapy. The patients' steps will be monitored daily for the first three chemotherapy cycles and compared with baseline recordings. Patients will be contacted daily and chemotherapy toxicity will be assessed by a physician. If significant toxicities are identified, the patient will be prompted to seek medical attention. The optimal cutoff point for detecting chemotherapy toxicity utilizing a decline in the number of daily steps will be chosen and validated. The adherence and satisfaction with the intervention will also be evaluated. This study could improve current methods and transform the way in which cancer care is delivered by demonstrating that a simple patient-centered measure obtained using a commercially available smartphone can aid in the accurate identification of clinically significant toxicities among a vulnerable population such as older adults with cancer."

During this study the subjects will be asked to attend the lab (or remotely due to covid restrictions) at the beginning of the study for baseline measurements and instructions on how to use / download the mobile application. Participants will have their anthropometrics measured (including height/ weight/ waist: hip circumference). The PROTEIN application will collect self-reported data from the user, which includes: user profile input, dietary and fluid intake, daily physical activity (such as step count), biochemistry, sleep and chewing (in- meal behaviour). Information on how users will interact with the app, which screens they use, how many log ons and how often data is inputted will also be collected. Throughout the trial, the participants will be contacted via the application or by the researchers to request feedback on their progress and to encourage reporting of any issues. Health care professionals will also be recruited to test the expert dashboard of the PROTEIN app. Through this system they will be able to provide nutrition/ physical activity advice directly to their patients and input their relevant biochemical results (such as haemoglobin for anaemic patients)."

            "Background: Although the health benefits of physical activity are well established, it remains challenging for people to adopt a more active lifestyle. Mobile health (mHealth) interventions can be effective tools to promote physical activity and reduce sedentary behavior. Promising results have been obtained by using gamification techniques as behavior change strategies, especially when they were tailored toward an individual's preferences and goals; yet, it remains unclear how goals could be personalized to effectively promote health behaviors. Objective: In this study, the investigators aim to evaluate the impact of personalized goal setting in the context of gamified mHealth interventions. The investigators hypothesize that interventions suggesting health goals that are tailored based on end users' (self-reported) current and desired capabilities will be more engaging than interventions with generic goals. Methods: The study was designed as a 2-arm randomized intervention trial. Participants were recruited among staff members of Noorderkempen governmental organization. They participated in an 8-week digital health promotion campaign that was especially designed to promote walks, bike rides, and sports sessions. Using an mHealth app, participants could track their performance on two social leaderboards: a leaderboard displaying the individual scores of participants and a leaderboard displaying the average scores per organizational department. The mHealth app also provided a news feed that showed when other participants had scored points. Points could be collected by performing any of the 6 assigned tasks (eg, walk for at least 2000 m). The level of complexity of 3 of these 6 tasks was updated every 2 weeks by changing either the suggested task intensity or the suggested frequency of the task. The 2 intervention arms-with participants randomly assigned-consisted of a personalized treatment that tailored the complexity parameters based on participants' self-reported capabilities and goals and a control treatment where the complexity parameters were set generically based on national guidelines. Measures were collected from the mHealth app as well as from intake and posttest surveys and analyzed using hierarchical linear models. Note: Eindhoven University of Technology is not an official GCP sponsor. Hence, this study is not a medical clinical trial."

According to WHO, diabetes is on the rise in developing countries; the current prevalence among the Pakistani population is 11.2% which is expected to increase in the coming years which is in line with the similar documented trend in neighboring south Asian countries.3,11 Since, ethnic south Asians carry a greater risk for developing T2D at a younger age and along with the complications associated with diabetes due to its chronicity, this poses a significant threat and an increased disease burden on the health care system.11 This will be the first trial conducted on determining the efficacy of caloric restriction in a subset of Pakistani population. There is limited inconsistent data on the efficacy of time-restricted feeding, however, this will help elucidate if it does lead to positive effects on the bio-health markers. One of the major hurdles in caloric restriction is patient compliance, therefore, one of the intervention group will be used to determine if TRF with caloric restriction helps improve the patient's compliance and produces significant results. If such an intervention is effective in inducing weight loss it can also be applied for other overweight patients. Eventually, it will help in countering the rising obesity in the region. The ultimate purpose of the knowledge obtained is to find a patient friendly, novel and therapeutic dietary intervention which will help in limiting the rise in T2D patients. It'll help in introducing an effective lifestyle intervention to promote health, which will reduce the dependence on pharmacological therapies, as well as, in the long-term reduce burden on the health care system. The information obtained can provide framework for new guidelines in helping the patients to lose weight, which can be utilized by the government to increase general awareness which will help prevent diseases linked to obesity. In light of the randomized controlled trial, the primary health physicians can educate and increase awareness regarding the different dietary interventions the patients can utilize which will help increase the number of options for the patients. Social media platforms can be utilized due to their extended outreach for the transmission of accurate information to the general population."

            "Research on glycemic control related to nuts or whole snack foods has focused primarily on tree nuts. Different processing and cooking methods have not been comprehensively analyzed to observe the effect on nutrient quality, bioavailability, or digestive absorption in peanuts. There is little to no research surrounding the nutrition of boiled peanuts so it may be of interest to compare boiled to roasted peanuts in terms of glycemic control. Peanuts have been shown to have a similar beneficial effect on glycemic control while being more financially accessible than almonds. Glycemic control could be improved based on the low glycemic index, high fiber, lipid, and or protein content of peanuts. The acute trial (phase 1) will investigate the impact of preprandial peanut consumption on glycemic response. The participants will complete an oral glucose tolerance test for both roasted and boiled peanuts. The long term study (phase 2&3) consists of participants consuming one serving per day of boiled or roasted peanuts in a four week crossover trial to observe any long term impact of daily peanut snacking on glycemic control. (Wash out weeks occurring between all trials.) At the conclusion of phase 2 & 3 an oral glucose tolerance test will be executed. The subjects will self record a exercise/step count and diet dairy, weight and waist to hip ratio will be measured weekly. The study will aim for a male and/or female healthy population from 18-65 years of age at NCSU."

            "Pregnancy and delivery are major stressors on the female body and contribute significantly to permanent weight gain and associated morbidity in women. This can profoundly affect the ability of active duty (AD) women to advance in their career. The first 12 weeks postpartum are the time period during which the most significant weight loss occurs and is critical in achieving a healthy weight in the first year postpartum. Many factors contribute to effective weight loss in this period among which the most critical are diet, exercise, and sleep. Breast feeding and depression may also affect weight changes postpartum. Research has shown diet to likely be the most crucial of these factors. The PADaWL study is designed as a randomized controlled trial to assess the effects of dietary intervention on weight and physical fitness versus routine postpartum care in the first year postpartum. Subjects will be primiparous AD women from any military service recruited in the obstetric clinic in the third trimester of pregnancy at Tripler Army Medical Center. Data will collected in an ambi-directional fashion with pre-pregnancy physical fitness data, demographic and pregnancy data collected at time of enrollment. Subjects will be randomized to receive intensive virtual sessions with a dietician vs routine postpartum care for the first 12 months postpartum. We will utilize a biometric device to monitor activity levels and sleep, web-based diaries to monitor breast feeding and diet, and validated questionnaires to evaluate depression as well as diet and sleep. Subjects will be monitored weekly for the first 12 weeks postpartum and will then be further evaluated at 6, 9 and 12 months postpartum. Primary outcome is weight at 12weeks postpartum and whether subjects have achieved military standards. Secondary outcome will be weight at 12 months postpartum and whether subject has achieved weight and fitness standards. The study intends to collect large amounts of data, and we intend to analyze which factors may be contributing to weight retention postpartum. This study should provide an accurate assessment of the effects of pregnancy on AD women. It should generate a clean and accurate dataset on which multiple follow-on studies can be performed and provide data for designing further intervention studies in postpartum women. The results of this study should also be able to assist in developing policy and guidance concerning AD women and pregnancy."

            "Introduction: It is known that weight loss results in decreased Resting Energy Expenditure (REE), due to a decrease in lean body mass (LBM), but also due to metabolic adaptation, resulting in a higher energy efficiency, responsible for weight regain. Powerlifting athletes submit themselves to caloric restriction before a competition to reach their desired weight category. After cessation of the restrictive diet body mass will quickly return to pre-diet values with a disproportionate gain of fat mass. To avoid fat gain 'reversed dieting' has become popular among athletes. This involves increasing caloric intake in a stepwise fashion with the assumption that the small increases in caloric intake might help to restore energy expenditure toward pre-dieting levels and decrease the chance of increasing fat mass. While anecdotal reports of successful reverse dieting are available, research is needed to evaluate its true efficacy. In addition, if the method would work in non-athletes this could be an important change in the risk of weight regain after a weight loss diet. . Aim: To test the effects of the reverse dieting protocol in the prevention of metabolic adaptation following a period of caloric restriction in weight training athletes. . Methods: A convenience sample of 3 powerlifters is used in this study. They are submitted to a 750kcal/day caloric deficit with a protein intake set at 2x bodyweight (kg) and 30%en from fat for 6 weeks, adjusted weekly. The reverse dieting protocol adds 100kcal during week 1-4 and 150kcal during week 5-8. REE is measured bi-weekly and body composition at day 1 of caloric restriction and day 1 and day 56 of reverse dieting. Exercise is kept constant during the entire period. ."

            "Cheer leading is a rapidly growing international sport known for its acrobatic skills and dangerous stunts. The sport presents ample risk for physical trauma, and it is common for athletes to miss extensive time from cheer leading due to injury. The goal of this study is to the see whether the investigators can reduce injury risk among cheer leading athletes by teaching them stress-coping skills to help them relax and reduce their sport-related stress. There exists a link between high levels of stress and increased rates of injury among athletes. When individuals become stressed during athletic events such as competitions or strenuous training, symptoms including muscle tension and narrowed attention often accompany the stress response, increasing injury risk and reducing performance quality. In this study, half of Western University's coed cheer leading team will participate in a six-session stress management intervention to teach them relevant psychological stress-coping skills. Such skills include relaxation breathing techniques, visualization exercises, stoppage of negative thoughts, and development of self-efficacy statements. The other half of the team will receive a placebo \"sport nutrition\" program. The sessions of both the control program and the stress-management intervention will be administered over the most intensive period of the cheer leading season, from September to November of 2019. The investigators predict that the intervention group athletes will report less cheer leading time missed due to injury, report less sport-related stress, and make fewer errors at their cheer leading championship than their teammates in the placebo group. This is the first study to administer a psychological injury-prevention intervention to cheerleaders."

            "There is clear evidence that regular exercise improves wellbeing and reduces the risk of diabetes related complications in people with type 1 diabetes. However, many people with type 1 diabetes do not exercise regularly. The primary reason for this is fear of hypoglycaemia and loss of glycaemic control associated with exercise. This loss of glycaemic control is associated with traditional moderate intensity continous aerobic exercise advocated in the guidelines for exercise in people with type 1 diabetes. Recent work (unpublished) from our lab suggests high intensity interval training (HIT) may reduce the risk of hypoglycaemia in people with type 1 diabetes, however stronger evidence is needed before firm conclusions can be drawn. Therefore, the aim of this study is to determine the effects of HIT on glycaemic control in people with type 1 diabetes compared to no exercise and traditional moderate intensity continous exercise. 24 people with type 1 diabetes will be recruited to complete a randomised counterbalanced cross over study comparing 3x 2-week interventions periods. During these intervention periods participant will maintain their habitual lifestyle but complete either no exercise (control), traditional moderate intensity continous exercise or high intensity interval training. Throughout the intervention periods participants glycaemic control will be monitored using a flash glucose monitor."

However, this success has led to a new era of research aiming to maximise the quality of life (QoL) of the aging CF population. Over recent decades, exercise training has become an integral part of CF management by improving ones aerobic exercise function and QoL. However, the effects exercise training has upon other aspects of the disease, e.g. metabolic and vascular abnormalities, remains largely unknown. The increased survival age associated with CF means the non-pulmonary co-morbidities are becoming increasingly prevalent and clinically important. For example, CF-related diabetes (CFRD) is one of the most common non-pulmonary co-morbidities of CF, and is associated with patients having a poorer pulmonary function and nutritional state, which ultimately leads to a worsened prognosis. Despite the efficacy of exercise training to manage dysglycaemia in other populations (e.g. type 2 diabetes mellitus only a single study has investigated its efficacy in patients with CF, whereby authors reported various encouraging findings (e.g. an improved OGTT score and insulin sensitivity). The present study aims to build on previous trials by comparing the therapeutic effects of a single session of high-intensity interval exercise (HIIE) and moderate intensity exercise (MIE) upon the 24 hour, ambulatory glycaemic profile of patients with CF. Additionally, the present study will identify whether HIIE and/or MIE can mediate the consequences of transient hyperglycaemia when considering: biomarkers of inflammation, oxidative stress and nitric oxide (NO2) bioavailability, as well as functional measures of microvascular endothelial function. The present study supports the top 10 research priorities set by the CF Trust, by further investigating the potential for exercise training to prevent/manage multiple aspects of CF, including dysglycaemia."

However, this success has led to a new era of research with the aim to maximise the quality of life (QoL) of the aging CF population. Recent research has demonstrated that the traditional method of determining disease progression, i.e. pulmonary function, no longer adequately predict survival rates. Therefore, various bodies have promoted cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET), as outcomes from this test (e.g. one's maximal O2 uptake [VO\u2082max]) are known predictors of the QoL, risk of hospitalisation and prognosis of individuals with CF. One of the most common non-pulmonary co-morbidities of CF is CF-related diabetes (CFRD). Importantly, CFRD is associated with a poorer pulmonary function compared to CF patients without CFRD, and ultimately a worsened prognosis. Despite this, the influence an impaired glycaemic control has upon the VO\u2082max derived from a CPET is unknown in CF. Therefore, the present study aims to assess whether VO\u2082max, an established determinant of QoL, differs between patients with CF with and without established CFRD as well as a group of age- and gender-matched healthy control subjects. The additional measures within the present study, such as: biomarkers of inflammation, redox balance and nitric oxide (NO2) bioavailability, as well as functional measures of microvascular endothelial function will aid our knowledge of the physiological abnormalities which are a cause or consequence of CFRD. Importantly, by identifying the factors which may contribute to CFRD progression and those that are viable for early intervention, mean the aims and objectives of this study are compatible with the top 10 research objectives set by the CF Trust."

Metabolic syndrome is a common progressive medical condition that is linked to obesity, diabetes, and heart disease. Obesity and metabolic syndrome are associated with abnormalities in gut flora which lead to chronic inflammation. This chronic inflammation is thought to worsen the insulin resistance and heart disease seen with metabolic syndrome. Current treatment strategies have shown limited effect, are expensive, and have side effects with long-term use. FMT is a one-time treatment that has been shown to replace the abnormal gut flora and improve metabolic disease by increasing anti-inflammatory short chain fatty acid (SCFA) production. However, the effects from FMT are not permanent. Prebiotic supplementation is one strategy that may help to extend the benefits of FMT by helping sustain high SCFA levels. At this point, it is not known how FMT and prebiotics work together to affect SCFA levels in participants with metabolic syndrome. This study will look at this interaction and answer if prebiotic therapy is effective in prolonging the benefits of FMT in participants with metabolic syndrome."

This is because the amount and types of foods in the diet eat can affect a person's weight, and because different foods are metabolised (processed) by the body in different ways. Scientists have also found that the bacteria in the human gut (the gut microbiome) affect their metabolism, weight and health and that, together with a person's diet and metabolism, could be used to predict appetite and how meals affect the levels of sugar (glucose) and fats (lipids) found in blood after eating. If blood sugar and fat are too high too often for too long, there is a greater chance of developing diseases such as diabetes and cardiovascular disease. The gut microbiome is different in different people. Only 10-20% of the types of bacteria found in the human gut are found in everyone. This might mean that the best diet to prevent disease needs matching to a person's gut microbiome and it might be possible to find personalised foods or diets that will help reduce the chance of developing chronic disease as well as metabolic syndrome. The study investigators are recruiting volunteers aged 18-70 years to take part in a study that aims to answer the questions above. Participants will be asked to consume standardised meals on up to 8 days while wearing glucose monitors (Abbott Freestyle Libre) to measure their blood sugar levels. Participants will also be required to prick their fingers at regular intervals to collect small amounts of blood, and to record their appetite, food, physical activity and sleep using apps and wearable devices. They will be asked to collect a fecal and saliva sample before consuming the standardised meals, and to provide a fasted blood sample at the end of the study period."

            "The purpose of this study is to determine if a weight loss app (VA MOVE!\u00ae Coach App) along with regularly scheduled telephone counseling, will motivate obese people with metabolic syndrome to lose weight and improve the symptoms of the metabolic syndrome, compared to usual weight loss approaches. This study will randomly assign participants to one of two groups, interventional or control. The interventional group will use the app with phone coaching and standard of care for weight loss. The control group will receive standard weight loss care without the app and phone coaching. Weight loss motivation to adopt life-style changes to maintain weight loss and quality of life between the two groups will be compared. The metabolic syndrome (MetS) is a cluster of disorders including high blood pressure, pre-diabetes, the tendency to carry body weight around the waist, and increased fat in the blood. When these problems happen together, there is an increased risk for heart attack, stroke, diabetes and certain cancers. Although the metabolic syndrome is a serious condition, it can be treated with diet, weight loss and increased activity. It can even be reversed using these lifestyle changes. Due to poor success with routine short-term weight loss treatment (group and one-on-one counseling), it is time to address the problem by a different method. Studies have shown feedback devices and weight loss apps have been successful in weight loss and weight maintenance. They are economical (many apps are free), and convenient to use, without attendance at group sessions. Since weight loss is the corner stone for improvement in the symptoms of the MetS, this study will offer a unique approach to support individuals who are committed to losing weight and adopting a healthier lifestyle. Numerous studies demonstrated that feedback via text messaging, and interaction through social networking support groups, in addition to iPhone apps, are all more effective in weight loss measures than group sessions at a hospital site. (Duncan et al., 2011; Greene, Sacks, Piniewski, Kil, & Hahn, 2012; Shaw et al., 2013; Spring et al., 2013). The benefit of these various methods is that they appear to accelerate weight loss and prevent weight re-gain if employed long-term. With technology changing daily, these approaches must be considered an essential adjunct to, or replacement for, traditional group counselling sessions."

            "The foods we eat - our diet - can affect whether we develop diseases during our lives, such as diabetes or heart disease. This is because the amount and types of foods we eat can affect our weight, and because different foods are metabolised (processed) by the body in different ways. Scientists have also found that the bacteria in our guts (the gut microbiome) affects our metabolism, weight and health and that, together with a person's diet and metabolism, could be used to predict appetite and how meals affect levels of sugar (glucose) and fats (lipids) found in blood after eating. If blood sugar and fat are too high too often, there's a greater chance of developing diseases such as diabetes. The gut microbiome is different in different people. Only 10-20% of the types of bacteria found in our guts are found in everyone. This might mean that the best diet to prevent disease needs matching to a person's gut microbiome and it might be possible to find personalised foods or diets that will help reduce the chance of developing chronic disease as well as metabolic syndrome. The study investigators are recruiting volunteers aged 18 years or over from the TwinsUK cohort to take part in a study that aims to answer the questions above. The participants will need to come in for a clinical visit where they will give blood, stool, saliva and urine samples. The participants will also be given a standardised breakfast and lunch and fitted with a glucose monitor (Abbott Freestyle Libre-CE marked) to monitor their blood sugar levels. After the visit, the participants will be asked to eat standardised meals at home for breakfast for a further 12 days. Participants will also be required to prick their fingers at regular intervals to collect small amounts of blood, and to record constantly their appetite, food, physical activity and sleep using apps and wearable devices."

The main questions it aims to answer are: 1. Can habitual sleeping habits predict, or do different types of sleepers alter, performance outcomes following sleep deprivation? 2. Does sleep deprivation alter blood pressure, heart rate, or metabolic responses during a 20-minute time trial, and/or are these altered amongst different types of sleepers? 3. Can habitual sleeping habits predict, or do different types of sleepers alter, flow-mediated dilation following a night of normal sleep and/or sleep deprivation? - Participants will be asked to perform 4 performance tests (20-minute time trial), 2 for familiarization, and 2 testing visits (1 under normal sleep and 1 under partial sleep deprivation). - For 1 week prior to each testing visit, sleep will be tracked using an ActiGraph device. - During each testing visit, and prior to the performance test, the vascular function of the superficial femoral artery will be assessed using a flow-mediated dilation technique. The investigators hypothesize that habitual early sleepers, poor sleepers, those with greater variability in sleep duration, and females will show the greatest impairments in performance and flow-mediated dilation following partial sleep deprivation."

The investigators have developed an online behavioral weight loss program that is effective, low-cost, and highly scalable. However, existing research suggests that tailoring treatment to address 3 well-established weight loss barriers in sexual minority women will be critical for maximizing the relevance and efficacy of behavioral weight loss for this group. In the Preparation Phase of this K23, the investigators developed 3 novel treatment components targeting sexual minority women's weight loss barriers (i.e., minority stress, low social support, and negative body image), the investigators piloted the program among sexual minority women of higher weight, and the investigators conducted individual qualitative interviews to elicit feedback on the intervention's acceptability, cultural relevance, usability, and feasibility, and this feedback was used to refine the program. In the Optimization Phase of this K23 (the current phase), 88 women will receive 12 weeks of Rx Weight Loss and will be randomized to receive 0-3 tailored components in a full factorial design with 23 (8) distinct combinations of components. Novel components that increase mean weight loss (by \u22652%) or the proportion of women achieving clinically meaningful weight loss (by \u226510%) at 6 months will be retained in a finalized obesity treatment package that the investigators will evaluate in a future randomized controlled trial (RCT) (Evaluation Phase). The aims of this study are to: Aim 2A (Optimization): Use a factorial experiment to determine how 3 novel components impact mean weight loss and the proportion of women achieving a 5+% weight loss at 6 months. Aim 2B (Mediation): Clarify how tailored components impact weight loss by testing hypothesized mechanisms of action (i.e., coping with stress, perceived social support, weight and shape concerns). This project will tailor and optimize an evidence-based online behavioral obesity treatment to enhance weight loss outcomes in sexual minority women."

            "Monetary incentive programs can reduce weight short-term; however, many studies have shown weight regain when the incentive program ends. This relapse is unsurprising; it is well-established that a specific behavior is extinguished when reinforcement for the behavior is removed. It is unlikely, then, given the expense, that monetary incentive programs could be implemented long-term for chronic diseases like obesity. Thus, programs are needed to bridge the gap between the short-term effects of a monetary incentive program and long-term effects at program end. A program that could be effective at bridging this gap is thought training, namely, episodic future thinking (EFT). EFT teaches individuals to think prospectively about future events as if they are happening now. EFT can reduce delay discounting (DD) which is defined as discounting larger rewards in the future for smaller rewards now (e.g. people with high DD levels may place more value on eating an unhealthy food now vs. the future health benefits of forgoing the food). It is suggested that EFT increases the value of the future reward and helps individuals make choices with lasting benefits. Given the power of EFT to reduce DD, it is plausible that EFT training during an incentive program could help shift one's thought processes towards the long-term consequences of behavior, promoting behavioral change even after the incentive program ends. Thus, the purpose of this study is to assess whether EFT promotes weight-loss in N=40 parent/child dyads (BMI \u2265 25) after a monetary incentive program ends vs. a control thought training program, Healthy Thinking (HT). We hypothesize: - The EFT and HT group will both have a reduction in BMI for adults/percent over BMI for children and weight from baseline during the monetary incentives program. - The EFT vs. HT group will have a greater reduction in BMI/percent over BMI and weight from baseline during the monetary incentives program. - The EFT group will maintain the reduction in BMI/percent over BMI and weight from baseline after the termination of the monetary incentives program. - The HT group will not maintain the reduction in BMI/percent over BMI and weight from baseline after the termination of the monetary incentives program. - The EFT vs. HT group will have a reduction in DD over time."

However, many sleep interventions (such as Cognitive Behavioural Therapy for Insomnia) are resource intensive and not widely available. Research demonstrates that smartphone interventions are an effective way to reach the wider population. However, many commercially available smartphone sleep applications focus on one technique, and hence do not tailor to the diverse needs of individuals. A new sleep app offers six different techniques, allowing individuals to shape their own journey to improved sleep quality. The investigators aim to test the sleep app's efficacy and gather user experience data to allow app optimisation. The study is a two-arm pilot randomised control trial (RCT). After recruitment and screening, baseline measurements will be taken: subjective sleep quality data will be collected using the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) and the Consensus Sleep Diary from all participants and objective accelerometry data via an Oura Ring (worn on finger for a week) on a subsample of participants. Participants will then be randomised to the intervention or control. Intervention participants will be given free use of the sleep app for 3 months. Controls will be informed that they will not receive access to the intervention and will be asked to abstain from using any other digital sleep-based intervention during the 3 months. All participants will be given the ISI after each month and will be given the Consensus Sleep Diary to fill out for one week again after 2 months. The planned Oura ring follow-up after 2 months for participants who wore the Oura ring at baseline has been cancelled due to COVID-19. User engagement will be assessed using the Digital Behaviour Change Intervention Engagement Scale. Telephone interviews will also be conducted with 20-30 participants to explore experience of using the app, how the comparison group felt about being allocated to the control group and how the COVID-19 pandemic may have affected their sleep and other measures of the study. Change in self-reported sleep will be the primary outcome and qualitative user data secondary. Appropriate tests (such as an ANOVA or linear regression controlling for baseline sleep and testing for effect of group when using continuous data) and thematic analysis of qualitative interview data will be conducted."

            "Ectopic fat is the accumulation of adipose tissue in anatomical sites not classically associated with fat storage - for example, in the liver and skeletal muscles. Excessive fat accumulation in liver cells, often diagnosed as non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), is a precursor to a wide range of liver conditions and metabolic disorders. The usual standard of care for NAFLD is to advise weight loss through controlled diet and physical activity, but the outcome of weight management and treatment of NAFLD is highly variable. Diet interventions - such as the Mediterranean, ketogenic, paleo, and high-protein-low-carbohydrate diets - have shown varied benefits in the management of NAFLD. However, food-based interventions must align with cultural and regional preferences in food to succeed in making the modifications part of the habitual diet. A recent diet intervention study (Della Pepa et al., 2020) highlighted that the components of a diet, rather than its caloric content, play a greater role in achieving healthier outcomes. In this study, a multifactorial diet intervention using locally sourced and produced meals will be implemented with the aim of reducing elevated liver fat content in healthy women diagnosed with NAFLD. The study will also evaluate the effects of the proposed diet on the participants' metabolic health and describe potential changes in their gut microbiome signatures (via frequent stool samples). The dysregulation of the gut microbiota has been linked to the development of NAFLD and it is known that the composition of the gut microbiota could be modified by dietary intake. This study will investigate the association of gut microbiome signatures with elevated liver fat in Asian women and test whether the dietary intervention will modify their gut microbiota. Finally, ectopic fat in the liver is a highly prevalent condition worldwide but the cut-off values for NAFLD has been largely derived from studies performed in Western populations. This study seeks to cross examine the diagnostic ranges in various clinical assessments of NAFLD that commonly involve ultrasound spectroscopy (Fibroscan), fatty liver indexes (FLI) and magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS). This effort seeks to derive appropriate cut-off values for NAFLD in Singaporean-Chinese women."

Longer and unsupervised studies are required to obtain guidelines for physical activity in MG patients. Further, the development of smart rings enables remote digital supervision of physical activity, sleep, and biological parameters such as heart frequency, number of steps, and temperature. These parameters could add to the lack of biomarkers in MG. The project design is a randomized controlled trial with a lifestyle intervention to improve fatigue in the autoimmune neuromuscular disease Myasthenia Gravis (MG).

Stress and burnout are risk factors that account for 10-20% of health expenditure and threaten work longevity in the world's fastest growing economies. Traditional face-to-face sources of mental care such as counseling and psychotherapy are effective as a countermeasure to stress, but not always accessible or acceptable for those with busy lifestyles. Because of this, there is an urgent need for on-demand, scalable interventions to reduce stress and improve mental and physical well being. Technology-based solutions are increasingly being proposed to fill this need. MindFi is a smartphone app that uses mindfulness exercises to help users cope with work stress and increase productivity. Since 2017, it has been featured by Apple, BBC, and Bloomberg and is being used at corporates such as Bain, Bloomberg, Cigna, and Zendesk. MindFi users contribute behavioral and self-report data, which are then used to generate individual recommendations for relevant, evidence-based exercises. These include mental care techniques such as mindfulness meditation, therapeutic journaling, psychosocial support and educational wellbeing quizzes. In this study, the investigators will recruit 200 participants in a randomized controlled design, with 100 receiving access to content of the MindFi app, and 100 receiving access to a version containing music tracks for relaxation. Each intervention will last 4 weeks. Participants will use these apps for a period of 5 weeks (for a minimum of 10 minutes per day). Pre- and post-intervention, the investigators will measure self-reported ratings on a number of psychological variables, and will track sleep quality objectively for a one-week period."

            "Mental health disorders are one of the most challenging chronic conditions to identify, treat and manage. This is largely due to the fact that diagnoses are almost entirely based on the patient's recall of current and past subjective experiences of symptoms; and then further interpreted by a healthcare professional introducing multiple layers of information biases in the formulation of a diagnosis. Accordingly, mental health conditions remain prevalent with high rates of misdiagnosis, inappropriate treatment and delayed intervention. In light of the heterogeneity across and within mental health conditions, a personalized interventional approach holds merit, yet the tools to effectively track an individual's day to day objective and subjective experience needed to achieve an individualized care approach have not until recently existed. Digital technologies such as passive and active sensing from smartphones and from wearable devices are shedding light on the capabilities of tracking new objective measures of health that could translate to key symptoms of mental health conditions. 'Multimodal data' approaches are those that attempt to translate a variety of electrical signals from digital devices to relevant health outcomes. The combination of digital devices to detect multimodal measures of mental health symptoms offers a unique opportunity to take a ground up approach in understanding the fluidity of mental health symptoms occurring at the individual level that might lend insight into new phenotypes of mental health illnesses that could have a physiological underpinning. The Study Investigators aim to characterize the multiplexing and fluid nature of mental health symptoms across individuals experiencing mental health symptoms and conditions using digital tools (i.e., wearables and mobile apps) and additional context information collected from virtual study support calls. The Investigators hope to know how objective measures from sensor data translate to core symptoms, episodes and flares across mental health disorders, and develop new (or new applications of) machine learning anomaly detection approaches and determine whether anomalies in expected symptom portraits can be reliably detected and enhanced by the addition of objectively measured data."

To address these issues, the present study aims to compare the efficacy of three different treatments using a large cohort of 600 students transitioning to college. Interventions were selected based on their potential for generalizability and cost-effectiveness on college campuses. The randomized controlled trial will assign 150 participants to one of four arms: 1) group-based therapy, 2) physical activity program, 3) nature experiences group, or 4) self-monitoring condition as the control group. In addition, biometric data will be collected from all participants using a wearable device to develop algorithmic predictions of mental and physical health functioning. Once recruitment is complete, modeling strategies will be used to evaluate the outcomes and effectiveness of each intervention. The findings of this study will provide evidence as to the benefits of implementing scalable and proactive interventions using technology with the goal of improving well-being and success of new college students."

This is a single centre, controlled, before and after, longitudinal, clinical trial. Participants will receive FluMist, a live attenuated influenza vaccine, which will act as a proxy to a viral respiratory tract infection and create a very minor response to the immune system. Vital signs and activity levels will be monitored continuously using wearable biosensors for 7 days prior to and 7 days following, along with symptom tracking and blood tests to measure immune responses. Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) algorithms will be used to analyse the data. AI and ML will identify subtle changes in vital signs and activity levels from the immune response to respiratory viruses. These data will help develop future methods to address important public health questions related to respiratory virus detection, containment and management.

The investigators will recruit a total of 276 self-declared Chronic Hematological Cancer (CHC) patients who (representative of age, race/ethnicity, and gender) will be on stable CHC pharmacologic therapy (if any), self-identify as sleep disturbed (>5 on Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index), do not have a sleep disorder diagnosis, do not take sleep medication/supplements >3 times per week, and are not currently practicing regular meditation. Aim 1: Test the efficacy of daily meditation (10 minutes/day) delivered via Calm compared to POD on the primary outcome of self reported sleep disturbance (Insomnia Severity Index (primary) and PROMIS Sleep Disturbance (secondary)) and secondary sleep outcomes including sleep impairment (PROMIS Sleep Impairment Scale) and sleep efficiency measured via sleep diaries and actigraphy. Hypothesis: Participants who are administered Calm will experience reduced sleep disturbance, and improvements in secondary sleep outcomes compared to POD at eight weeks. Aim 2: Test the efficacy of daily meditation (10 minutes/day) delivered via Calm compared to POD on inflammatory markers (i.e., TNF-a, IL-6, IL-8, CRP), fatigue, and emotional distress (i.e., anxiety, depressive symptoms measured with PROMIS\u00ae). Hypothesis: Participants who are administered Calm will have greater reductions in fatigue, emotional distress and inflammatory markers compared to POD at eight weeks. Aim 3: Explore the sustained effects (i.e., 20 weeks from baseline) of Calm in CHC patients. Hypothesis: (a) Participants in Calm will have greater reductions in sleep disturbance, fatigue, emotional distress and inflammatory markers compared to POD at 20 weeks; (b) Total meditation time and sustained meditation usage overtime, but not time of day or use of non-meditative content (e.g., Sleep Stories), will be related to improved outcomes at 20 weeks."

Delirium is a serious clinical problem in hospitalized adults. It is the most common neuropsychiatric complication of hospitalization and is associated with high patient burden, increased morbidity and mortality, prolonged length of stay, higher costs, and institutionalization. An early, accurate diagnosis as well as an adequate management are critical to the continued health and functional independence of the affected patients. Prevention strategies contain pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions. However, their clinical success (effectiveness) is limited and the evidence for the use of pharmacological interventions for the prevention or management of delirium is scarce. The prediction of delirium has become a new promising topic in clinical research. New approaches like the implementation of wearable sensors, in particular wearable accelerometer devices to record movements related to delirium are promising. In this study, the study procedure only includes wearing two types of consumer-grade sensors on the body (wrist and finger of the not-dominant hand). This way, vital parameters are measured in order to identify patterns."

As a secondary objective, preliminary effects of the intervention on cognition, brain resting-state functional connectivity, gait, cardiac autonomic regulation, and psychosocial factors (i.e. quality of life, and levels of depression, anxiety, and stress) will be explored. This allows to synthesize data for a sample size calculation on basis of a formal power calculation for a future RCT. A two-arm, parallel-group, single-blinded (i.e. outcome evaluator of pre- and post-measurements blinded to group allocation) pilot randomized controlled study with an allocation ration of 2 : 1 (i.e. intervention : control) including 17 - 25 older adults with mNCD will be conducted between June and December 2021. The active control group will proceed with usual care as provided by the memory clinics where the patients are recruited. The intervention group will perform a twelve-week training intervention according to a newly developed exergame-based intervention concept in addition to usual care. Primary outcomes will be assessed throughout the training intervention period. The measurements of all secondary outcomes will be conducted at ETH H\u00f6nggerberg within two weeks prior to starting (PRE) and after completing (POST) the study intervention."

Common symptoms include fatigue, shortness of breath, and cognitive dysfunction, among others, and result in an impact on daily functioning. Symptoms may be new onset, appear after initial recovery from an acute episode of COVID-19, or persist after the initial illness. Cardiac variability (HRV) was initially used in COVID-19 to predict mortality in the acute setting. Dysautonomia which partly evaluates HRV is frequent in patients with persistent COVID. Several groups have used voice or other respiratory noise analysis for the diagnosis of acute COVID. Patients in the persistent COVID cohort will be able to be differentiated from an age, sex and vaccination status matched cohort of recovered COVID patients without sequelae by means of a model created by Machine Learning that will be trained using cardiac variability (HRV), skin conductance and acoustic analysis data. The primary objetive will be to obtain a classification algorithm by Machine Learning to differentiate the group of patients with persistent COVID diagnosis from the paired group of recovered COVID patients without sequelae."

Heart rate variability (HRV) measurement method can be used to evaluate ANS activity. HRV is a non-invasive method and is a measure of the change in heart rate over a period of time. HRV is a scalar quantity that shows the time between two beats of the heart and defines the oscillations between the R-R intervals. In HRV measurements, time-dependent and frequency-dependent measurement results are obtained and from these measurements, time-dependent RMSSD (square root of the square of the difference of the R-R intervals) and frequency-dependent high-frequency (HF) and low frequency (LF) measurement components are used in relation to the sympathetic nervous system (CNS) and parasympathetic nervous system (PSS). HRV can be measured in short-term (5 minutes) in terms of measurement time.

            "Temporomandibular joint dysfunction (TMD) is a broad clinical picture involving the TMJ and its disc, masticatory musculature, ligament tissue, and autonomic nervous system (ANS). TMD symptoms include decrease or excessive increase in joint range of motion (ROM), clicking sound or crepitation in the joint, pain around the joint or muscle group, chewing and swallowing problems. Pain caused by MPS, trigger point, fatigue, limitation of ROM, and ANS dysfunction cause TMD. With the inclusion of habits such as clenching and bruxism, pain, spasm and disability develop in the chewing muscles. Exposure to repeated trauma and excessive use of chewing muscles may cause the formation of tight bands and trigger points, which are characterized by MPS. When the relationship between TMD and ANS was examined, it was observed that increased sympathetic activity and decreased parasympathetic activity were effective in the severity of TMD symptoms. Auricular vagus nerve stimulation is a peripheral, non-pharmacological and non-invasive neuromodulation technique that modifies signal processing in the CNS, activates reflex circuits, exploits brain plasticity for different therapeutic purposes, thereby affecting very different areas of the brain. Non-invasive or transcutaneous Vagus Nerve Stimulation delivery systems provide stimulation in the auricular branch of the vagus nerve in the outer ear, thus eliminating the need for surgical implantation. The aim of our study is to reveal the extent to which Auricular Vagus Nerve Stimulation, applied in addition to the conventional rehabilitation program, affects the results of the treatment by stimulating the parasympathetic nervous system in patients with Temporomandibular Joint Dysfunction caused by Myofascial Pain Syndrome."

Three different experimental studies (physical fatigue, mental fatigue and combined) will be performed with a randomized, single-blinded, placebo controlled, counter-balanced, cross-over design. The objectives of the projects are as follows: - To experimentally assess the role of a dopamine, and a noradrenalin reuptake inhibitor in the onset of exercise-induced fatigue - To identify changes in brain activation associated with altered PF and fatigue perception - To experimentally assess the effect of a NA or DA reuptake inhibitor on MF, brain activation and the sources of changes in brain activation - To experimentally assess the role of brain neurotransmitters (DA, NA) in the interaction between mental and PF from a neurophysiological perspective. Participants will be healthy young adults. In each study, they will start with a familiarization trial followed by two experimental trials and one control trial with a randomized treatment order. At each visit, different drugs will be administered to elicit different neurotransmitter response. The trials will be performed at the MFYS exercise lab (BLITS, VUB campus Etterbeek, Boulevard General Jaques 271, 1050 Elsene (Brussels)). Depending on the type of study they are participating in, participants will perform three distinct tasks: - In the first experimental study participants will perform a 60-min Stroop Task to elicit mental fatigue. - In the second experimental study participants will perform a knee-extension exercise until exhaustion to elicit physical fatigue. - In third experimental study participants will first preform a mental fatiguing task (Stroop taks) followed by physical fatigue task (knee extension). While participants will perform above mentioned task their EEG signal and heart rate will be measured. At the same time, participants will report on their subjective feeling of fatigue during these tasks. In addition, all participants will be administered cognitive tasks before and after the study, along with questionnaires. In the second and third experiments, tensiomyography and electromyography will also be recorded from the quadriceps muscle of the leg used for knee extension. Researchers will compare physiological and behavioural changes in response to specific neurotransmitter drug to answer the main question: what the role of a DA and a NA reuptake inhibitor on the onset of mental and physical fatigue is."

            "Long COVID is a common but highly debilitating illness which develops after infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2 or COVID-19). It is thought to affect as many as 1 in 7 people following COVID-19 infection. It can produce a vast array of symptoms including fatigue, breathlessness, fast heart rate, blood pressure disturbance, temperature disturbance, and dry mouth. Many of these symptoms could be explained by the nervous system being predominantly in a stress or 'fight or flight' response, also known as dysautonomia. One way of assessing whether this is the case is by measuring heart rate variability (HRV). This is the time variation between heart beats and is a marker of how stressed the nervous system is or how strong is the 'fight or flight' response. Heart rate variability can be measured using devices which are worn round the wrist or attach to the chest. An increased variability in heart rate corresponds with a more relaxed nervous system and decreased variability with a more stressed nervous system. Monitoring HRV in real-time and implementing interventions such as a breathing regime to maximise HRV is known as HRV biofeedback. The body can be trained out of the fight or flight response and into the 'rest and digest' mode response of the nervous system in this way and potentially significantly improve symptoms. We propose that for people with Long COVID, a programme of structured breathing exercises over 4 weeks whilst tracking HRV can demonstrate an improvement in HRV and consequently improve Long COVID symptoms."

            "Background: Neonatal sepsis is the leading cause of mortality in preterm newborns. The autonomic nervous system modulates the response to sepsis through the cholinergic anti-inflammatory reflex. However, premature neonates exhibit immaturity of the autonomic nervous system, which could increase the risk of sepsis. Kangaroo Care (skin-to-skin contact) may promote autonomic nervous system modulation and maturation in preterm newborns with sepsis. The objective of this study is to determine the effect of Kangaroo Care on heart rate variability in preterm newborns with late-onset clinical sepsis. Methods: A cross-over randomized clinical trial will be conducted, including 20 preterm infants with late-onset sepsis. The autonomic nervous system will be assessed using heart rate variability analysis. The study interventions consist of routine care in an incubator and Kangaroo Care. Randomization will be performed using a four-block permuted design for the two intervention sequences AB: Kangaroo Care - incubator care, or BA: incubator care - Kangaroo Care. Heart rate variability will be recorded using a Polar Rs800 monitor and analyzed with Kubios software. Discussion: This study will provide information on the relationship between Kangaroo Care and autonomic nervous system activity in preterm neonates with late-onset sepsis. These data will contribute to the understanding of the cholinergic anti-inflammatory reflex in neonates and the capacity of skin-to-skin contact to modulate autonomic activity in neonatal infection. Thus, the study seeks to provide initial evidence for the use of skin-to-skin contact as a non-pharmacological therapeutic intervention in neonatal sepsis."

The primary outcome is reduction in mean monthly headache days between groups at 12 weeks. Secondary outcomes include mean change in acute analgesic use frequency, depression, migraine-related disability, stress, insomnia, and catastrophizing between groups at 12 weeks. Tertiary outcomes include change in heart rate variability and device-related user experience measures."

            "Exercising in a nature setting has been credited with benefits for health and well-being, more so than exercising indoors. Additionally, motoric performance in the same exercise (e.g., running speed, more strenuous physical activity) has been reported in some studies to be greater if practiced outdoors, in a nature setting. The explanation may be in the inherent variability of natural landscapes, the textures, elevations, obstacles and objects which are not found in standard built and indoor settings. Indoor settings are characterized by safe, organized, patterned textures and objects created for specific ends, which inhibit variability in physical and physiological behavior. Variability in the environment turns into variability in body systems, which benefits health, well-being, and skill acquisition. Variability in behavior depends also on the task. Running or walking is essentially a journey throughout the environment in which interaction with obstacles, puddles, and other runners is part of the variability of the activity. On the other hand, physical activity such as HICT is done in a small area, and is a scripted, prescribed activity (e.g., push-ups, sit-ups), which lowers the amount of variability in behavior. The aim of this trial is to test if a low variability activity shows differences in performance, wellbeing, and behavior measures according to the amount of variability in the environment. In this trial the participants will engage in two high intensity circuit training (HICT) interventions - one in an indoor setting, and another in a nature setting. The HICT intervention includes 12 calisthenic exercises, and will be performed at a self-selected intensity by the participants. Each exercise will be performed during one minute, followed by 30 seconds of rest where the participants will be instructed what the next exercise will be. Before exercising, the participants put a heart rate monitor and two inertial measurement units (IMUs) on the right arm and leg, according to the correct usage guidelines, and rate their positive affect, arousal, and perceived exertion. Immediately after exercising, they rate the same measures again. Research Hypotheses: Greater movement variability, heart rate variability, performance, wellbeing, and arousal during HICT in nature setting than indoor setting."

The objective of this study was to determine the acute effect of low and high-dose BA trials on maximal aerobic speed (MAS) in endurance athletes. We hypothesized that high doses of BA have a greater effect than low doses, both compared to baseline. Twelve male endurance athletes volunteered for the study. The experimental design applied was randomized cross-over, double-blind. Treatment included three 6-minute run tests (6-MRT), the first as a baseline, then randomized 6-MRT with low (30 mg\u00b7kg-1) and high (45 mg\u00b7kg-1) dose BA trials. The 6-MRTs were separated by 72 hours. The main variable of the study was the distance (m) performed in the 6-MRT. Differences between tests were established through ANOVA and Tukey's multiple comparison tests (p < 0.05)."

In the study, Wingate-based HIIT program was applied three days a week for six weeks. Anaerobic power (Wingate anaerobic power test), heart rate variability (Polar H10 chest band), leg strength (back and leg dynamometer) and body composition (PlusAvis 333) measurements of the participants were made 1 week before the training program started and the week after the training program ended. Twenty physically active adult men aged 18-30 were voluntarily included for the study. Participants were divided into two groups: Wingate-based HIIT with creatine supplementation (K-HIIT) and Wingate-based HIIT only (HIIT). As a result of the analysis, it was seen that creatine supplementation taken together with wingate-based HIIT had an effect and increased on the anaerobic power parameters, peak power, average power and minimum power values, and leg strength. In addition, it was determined that heart rate variability parameters improved heart rate (HR, beat/min) and low frequency (LF, ms2) values, but did not cause any change in body composition. Comparing and investigating the effects of different HIIT methods on anaerobic power, leg strength, heart rate variability and body composition will increase the generalizability of the study."

The primary experimental hypothesis that underpins these aims is: \u2022 Low-intensity exercise with BFR is a tolerable, acceptable, and safe exercise modality in COPD patients. 40 patients attending clinics at University Hospitals of Leicester (UHL) National Health Service (NHS) Trust with diagnosed COPD will be randomly allocated to a home-based body weight exercise intervention either with or without the blood flow restriction (n=20 in each group). The body weight exercise will consist of five body weight exercises including: sitting knee extensions, standing knee raise, heel-toe raises, bilateral mini-squat behind a chair, and chair rise/sit to stand. In addition to the pre and post intervention visits, the initial two training sessions for both groups will be directly supervised in the research centre. These sessions are to ensure all exercises are performed correctly and safely and the patient become familiar with the exercises and BFR equipment and mobile application, which provides exercise guidance and session recording."

OBJECTIVES: This study systematically explores the effectiveness of a newly developed exergame-based motor-cognitive training concept (called 'Brain-IT') targeted to improve cognitive functioning in older adults with mNCD. METHODS: A two-arm, parallel-group, single-blinded (i.e. outcome evaluator of pre- and post-measurements blinded to group allocation) randomized controlled trial with an allocation ration of 1 : 1 (i.e. intervention : control) including 34 - 40 older adults with mNCD will be conducted between May 2022 and December 2023. The control group will proceed with usual care as provided by the (memory) clinics where the patients are recruited while the intervention group will perform a twelve-week training intervention according to the newly developed 'Brain-IT' exergame-based training concept in addition to usual care. As a primary outcome, global cognitive functioning will be assessed using the Quick Mild Cognitive Impairment Screen (Qmci). As secondary outcomes, domain-specific cognitive functioning, brain structure and function, spatiotemporal parameters of gait, instrumental activities of daily living, psychosocial factors (e.g. quality of life, and levels of depression, anxiety, stress), and cardiac vagal modulation (heart rate variability at rest) will be assessed. Both, the pre- and the post-measurements will take place within two weeks prior to starting or after completing the intervention."

Previous studies have shown a positive spiral between state mindfulness and positive affect (Du, An, Ding, Zhang, & Xu, 2018). The mindful coping model (Garland, Gaylord, & Fredrickson, 2011) suggested that the state of mindfulness can lead to reappraisal and reframing of their stressful circumstances which further lead to positive emotion and reduced stress. These positive effects will affect the next cycle and hence form a positive spiral. Since mindful breathing was an effective practice for immediate decentering (Feldman, Greeson, & Senville, 2010), it will be used as the manipulation of state mindfulness. Besides, there is very limited research on the associations between these constructs using EMA and actigraphy. Therefore, this study will explore this association by manipulating the state of mindfulness with mindful breathing using EMA."

            "Background: Falls are common in elderly individuals and those with neurological conditions like Parkinson's disease. Parkinson's disease causes postural instability and mobility issues that lead to falls and reduced quality of life. The fear of falling (FoF), a natural response to unstable balance, can exacerbate postural control problems. However, evaluating FoF relies primarily on subjective self-reports due to a lack of objective assessment methods. Objectives: This mixed-methods feasibility study aims to develop an objective method for assessing fear of falling during motion and walking using virtual reality. This protocol examines a range of FoF-related responses, including cognitive, neuromuscular, and postural stability factors. Methods: Parkinson's disease patients and healthy controls will complete questionnaires, movement tasks, and walking assessments in real and virtual environments where FoF can be elicited using virtual reality (VR) technology. Data from center-of-pressure measurements, electromyography, heart rate monitoring, motion capture, and usability metrics will evaluate the method's acceptability and safety. Semi-structured interviews will gather participants' and researchers' experiences of the protocol. Discussion: This method may allow accurate assessment of how FoF impacts movement by measuring cognitive, neuromuscular, and postural responses during gait and motion. Virtual environments reproduce real-life scenarios that trigger FoF. Rigorously assessing FoF with this approach could demonstrate its ability to quantify the effects of FoF on movement. Conclusions: This protocol aims to improve FoF assessment by evaluating multiple responses during movement in virtual environments. It addresses current measures' limitations. A feasibility study will identify areas for improvement specific to Parkinson's disease. Successful validation could transform how FoF is evaluated and managed."

The strain of providing care for a loved one diagnosed with AD, often across several years, is associated with elevated depression risk and poorer overall health. Emotion regulation skills represent an ideal target for psychological intervention to promote healthy coping in ADRD caregivers. The project seeks to use an experimental medicine approach to test the efficacy and biobehavioral mechanisms of a novel, relatively brief, targeted, scalable, smartphone-based cognitive emotion regulation intervention aimed at improving psychological outcomes (i.e., reducing perceived stress, caregiver burden, and depressive symptoms) in ADRD unpaid primary caregivers as well as examine potential benefits of the caregiver intervention on quality of life in care recipients. Cognitive reappraisal is the ability to modify the trajectory of an emotional response by thinking about and appraising emotional information in an alternative, more adaptive way. Reappraisal can be operationalized via two primary tactics: psychological distancing (i.e. appraising an emotional stimulus as an objective, impartial observer) and reinterpretation (i.e., imagining a better outcome than what initially seemed apparent). The project will investigate the efficacy and underlying biobehavioral mechanisms of a novel, one-week cognitive reappraisal intervention in this population, with follow-up assessments at 2 weeks, 4 weeks, and 3 months. ADRD unpaid primary caregivers will be randomly assigned to receive training in either distancing, reinterpretation, or a no regulation natural history control condition, with ecological momentary assessments of self-reported positive and negative affect, remotely- collected psychophysiological health-related biomarkers (i.e., heart rate variability data) using pre-mailed Polar H10 chest bands, and health-related questionnaire reports. Distancing training is expected to result in longitudinal reductions in self-reported negative affect, longitudinal increases in positive affect, and longitudinal increases in HRV that are larger than those attributable to reinterpretation training and no-regulation control training."

The investigators hypothesize that a ketone monoester supplement will acutely decrease systolic and diastolic blood pressure compared to the placebo. The same results are expected for diurnal and nocturnal blood pressure. - To determine if acute consumption of a ketone monoester supplement improves glucose control measured with continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) following a standardized meal consumed 90 minutes after ingestion of the ketone supplement. The investigators hypothesize that a ketone monoester supplement, consumed 90 minutes before a meal, will decrease the 2-hour postprandial glucose incremental area under the curve (iAUC) and peak glucose compared to a placebo. - To assess IL-10's ability to inhibit proinflammatory cytokine production (TNF- \u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2) in LPS-stimulated whole blood cultures following the ingestion of \u03b2-OHB and placebo. The investigators hypothesize that \u03b2-OHB will augment the ability of IL-10 to inhibit TNF-\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 production compared to placebo. Using a double-blind placebo-controlled randomized crossover study design, 15 adults will participate in two experimental conditions. Participants will be recruited using a local recruitment database (Nab\u00fb), during presentations in community organizations, with posters at the University of Sherbrooke, and from word of mouth. Following screening, eligible participants will be invited for one baseline and two experimental conditions at the Research Centre on Aging (CdRV). During the baseline visit, the following assessments and tests will be conducted: - resting heart rate (HR) and blood pressure; - anthropometry and body composition; - medical history and questionnaires on physical activity levels, dietary habits and anxiety symptoms; - explanation of the dietary and physical activity logs; - installation of accelerometers to control physical activity levels and sedentary behaviors over 10 days and CGM to assess glucose control over the subsequent 10 consecutive days. During the week following the baseline condition, participants will be invited to the laboratory for their first experimental condition (duration = 240 minutes). Participants will come to the lab in a fasted state (at least 12-hour overnight) to the lab at 8:00 am where following assessments and tests will be conducted: - resting heart rate (HR) and blood pressure; - ketone supplement or placebo consumption; - blood samples and cold pressor test; - standardized breakfast; - galvanic skin response; - visual analog scales assessing gastrointestinal discomfort, hunger and fullness; - installation of ABPM and explanation of the dietary and physical activity logs.

To evaluate a passive industrial exoskeleton for back support, a protocol was developed in which individual production operations will be modeled. This research will recruit 9 valunteers. During a 4-hour laboratory visit, each subject will perform three identical experimental tests: one test without an exoskeleton and two tests using two different modifications of the exoskeleton prototype. To avoid sequence bias, the test order will be randomized (balanced). Two types of labor operations will be simulated. One operation will consist in lifting the load, which is 20% of the volunteer's body weight, from a height of 14 cm to a surface with a height of 70 cm, the frequency of lifting is 1 time in 30 seconds. The second operation is holding a cargo weighing 5 kg in a forced working position (tilt of the body more than 30 \u00b0) for 1 minute, after which rest will follow for 1 minute, and then the work will be repeated. Both types of work will be performed for 105 minutes, then a break of 15 minutes, then 105 minutes of work. Heart rate, blood pressure, ECG (Custo) will be monitored.

Adherence to catheter regimen and proper emptying of the bladder is of clinical relevance for clean intermittent catheterisation. A Daily Fluid Diary is included in this pilot study together with the use of the microphone of the Apple\u2122 Smart Watch to investigate the feasibility of tracking input and output of fluids. The user acceptance of the Daily Fluid Diary offered via the iPhone app and the feasibility of the microphone to capture bladder emptying or voiding are to be tested within this pilot."

Physical Activity (PA) is recognized as having many health benefits, many of them related to obesity and its comorbidities. Despite of all the efforts, the majority of the overweight children/adolescents still present low levels of PA and high levels of sedentary behaviors. Thus, it seems that the greatest challenge is to influence behavior change in order to increase PA exposure in this population. PA consultation can be a cost-effective way of enhancing PA and improve weight status among overweight children. The main objective of this study is to analyze if the inclusion of a PA consultation in a multidisciplinary program for the management of adolescent overweight improves body mass index (BMI) z-score, PA levels and sedentary behavior outcomes at six and twelve months, compared to those attending only the Pediatric and the Dietetic consultations. This study was designed as a non-randomized, controlled clinical trial with six months duration and follow-up at the 12th month, that will include overweight adolescents (BMI \u2265 p85) aged 12 to 17, attending the Clinic for the first time, and accepted to be enrolled. Those with (i) major pathologies (other than obesity or its related comorbidities), (ii) inability to perform regular PA, (iii) mental disorders, (iv) smoking habits, (v) under any kind of prescription (other than antihypertensives or metformin), or (vi) being involved in another weight loss program will be excluded. According to the sample size calculation, we expect to recruit 129 participants that will be allocated in three groups by consecutive sampling: (i) control group - standard care (Pediatric and Dietitian consultations); (ii) intervention group I - standard care plus PA consultation; (iii) intervention group II - 2 weekly exercise sessions additionally to the standard care and PA consultations.."

However, the current systems of rehabilitation delivery face two main challenges. Patients are not receiving the amount and kind of evidence-based rehabilitation they need due to the lack of rehabilitation professionals' experts in the field. The rehabilitation setting is not adequate for the long-term management and monitoring of these patients. To date, no randomized controlled trials are evaluating the effectiveness of Telemedicine in the management of patients with FMD. This is a single-blind randomized-controlled trial (RCT) with 2-parallel arms to demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of a 5-day intensive rehabilitation treatment followed by a telemedicine program on the motor, non-motor symptoms (pain, fatigue, anxiety, and depression), the self-perception of clinical change and Health-Related Quality of Life, and health care costs in patients with FMDs."

The secondary objective of this study will be to evaluate the association between AGEs accumulation and shoulder pain, function, strength, kinematics and tendon thickness in individuals with type 2 DM. Methodology: is a single-blinded randomized controlled trial, in which all subjects with a clinical diagnosis of type 2 DM (with at least 1 year of diagnosis), of both sexes, between 40 and 70 years, presenting shoulder pain (uni or bilateral) for at least 3 months with a pain intensity score from 3 points on a numerical rating scale for pain intensity, will be invited to participate. The main outcomes of this study will include the AGEs accumulation through skin autofluorescence measurement; shoulder pain through NRS scales; shoulder function through SPADI questionnaire and range of motion measurement; isometric shoulder muscles strength through manual muscle dynamometer measurement; shoulder kinematics through three dimensional inertial units measurements; supraspinatus tendon thickness through ultrasound measurement. All these outcomes will be measured before and after the rehabilitation protocols. Participants will be randomly assigned to one of the two rehabilitation groups: specific shoulder rehabilitation protocol group (SRG); or 2) specific protocol of shoulder rehabilitation plus aerobic exercise group (ARG). All individuals will be evaluated before starting the rehabilitation protocol (baseline) and at the end of rehabilitation (post 12 weeks) and 8 weeks after the end of the rehabilitation (follow up). For the statistical analysis, to verify the effectiveness of protocols over time, a variance analysis (ANOVA) of mixed model with Bonferroni adjustment will be performed for pairwise comparisons. Variables that do not meet the ANOVA assumptions will be analyzed by the Mann-Whitney and Wilcoxon tests with Bonferroni correction a priori. In order to assess the secondary objective of the study, correlation tests depending on data distribution will be performed (Pearson or Spearman correlation tests). A simple linear regression analysis will also be performed in order to analyze how much the AGEs accumulation can explain the alterations in the musculoskeletal and biomechanical variables. The significance level will be set at 5%."

            "Measurement of cardiorespiratory fitness (here VO2max) is considered a valuable tool for improving the risk prediction of cardiovascular disease and overall patient management (Ross et al. 2016, American Heart Association statement). However, the gold standard method for determining VO2max requires both maximal exercise until exhaustion and expensive equipment, why it is not always feasible. A new method for estimating VO2max using a non-exercise prediction model with seismocardiography (SCG) information has been proposed (S\u00f8rensen et al. 2020, Hansen et al. 2021). SCG is recording and interpretations of vibrations originating from the beating heart measured on the chest wall with an accelerometer. SCG has previously been shown to correlate to physiologic events in the cardiac cycle (S\u00f8rensen et al. 2018) and thus a measure of cardiac performance. VO2max is generally believed to be limited by the rate of oxygen delivery to the muscles, where maximal cardiac output and oxygen carrying capacity of the blood are considered the main limiting factors. The theoretical basis for incorporating SCG to a VO2max prediction model is therefore evident. The previous studies by S\u00f8rensen et al. 2020 and Hansen et al. 2021 assessed the prediction model in a cross-sectional study design to compare validity of the method. A requirement of further validation of the prediction model with reliability assessment is therefore needed. Biological age is a concept trying to relate the age to the health status rather than the date of birth. Biological age assesses the heterogeneity in functional metabolic status and vulnerability to disease. A Biological age model has previously been designed for health promotion interventions (Husted et al. 2020). However, reliability assessment of the model is needed. The purpose of the current study was therefore to: 1. investigate the validity and reliability of a new clinical method for estimation of maximal oxygen consumption (VO2max) using seismocardiography. 2. investigate the reliability of the biological age model."

Methods:Thirty-three moderately-active middle-aged and healthy participants were randomly assigned to the strength+aerobic group (SAG, n = 16) and aerobic+strength group (ASG, n = 17). Body composition, aerobic endurance, respiratory parameters and upper and lower strength were assessed before (pre-test) and after (post-test) a 13-week intervention. The chi-square test and the independent t-test will be used to compare sociodemographic variables between the groups. A 2 x 2 analysis of variance (ANOVA) with repeated measures (group x measurement) will be conducted. This study will enhance our understanding of the concurrent training effect on muscle composition and strength. These training programs allow for reducing the duration of the training, which can be an important factor in making adults more willing to participate in physical activity."

            "While the association of physical and/or motor and/or cognitive components with training can generate synergistic effects and thus create an efficient cognitive enrichment program, very few studies have focused on finding an optimal combined program for older adults. According to the model of Herold and his colleagues, there are two modalities of simultaneous combined training: Thinking While Moving (TwM), when the additional cognitive task is not linked to the motor task, and Moving While Thinking (MwT), when the cognitive task is integrated into the motor task. They assume the latter approach is the most promising for improving cognitive reserve. Nevertheless, to the investigators' knowledge, only one study has compared these two modalities in older adults and none has broadened the question by comparing several MwT trainings. The goal of this interventional study will be to compare the cognitive, dual-task, and physical effects of 6 physical and/or cognitive programs in healthy but inactive older adults. The main questions it will aims to answer are: - Will the Moving While Thinking and Thinking While Moving programs have the same effects? - If they have different effects, which will be the best way to improve cognitive, dual-task, and physical functions? The study is being set up between 2023 and 2025 to compare the cognitive, dual- ask and physical effects of 6 programs (3 months, 2 sessions of 1 hour per week). Three experimental MwT programs will be studied: Immersive and interactive wall exergames (I2WE), Complex Cognitive and Motor Activities (2CMA), and exergames with Switch (EXER).

A control group (CON) will be also created.

            "Community service providers (CSPs), such as promotores and other community health staff, play an essential role in preserving health and treating disease in underserved Hispanic/Latinx (HL) communities with disproportionately high rates of cardiometabolic (CM) disease. Although effective programs have been developed that deploy CSPs to reduce CM disease risk in the community, to our knowledge no interventions have sought to reduce CM risk among CSPs themselves. However, CSPs are also at high risk for adverse CM outcomes, as they have the same high-risk demographics as the communities they serve and they work in high-stress, frontline jobs. Reducing CM risk among HL CSPs is crucial to promote health at both the individual and community levels; that is, preventive interventions delivered to CSPs may not only promote the health of the individual CSPs who receive the intervention but also may bolster CSPs to more effectively deliver programming that protects CM health community-wide. The proposed study employs relational savoring (RS), a brief intervention rooted in positive psychology and attachment, which has previously been shown to promote psychosocial well-being and which is particularly efficacious in HL populations. Emerging research supports that RS may also promote more optimal cardiovascular regulation and health behavior. Therefore, the investigators deliver RS to CSPs in order to identify CM health protective effects for both CSPs and the high-risk communities they serve. Aims and Hypotheses: Aim 1: Examine effects of RS on CSPs' CM risk factors and outcomes. Hypotheses: RS (compared to wait-list control) will be associated with lower CM risk, as indexed by higher mean HRV, both during a stressor and at rest (H1A). RS will also be associated with a more favorable CM health behavior profile, indexed by higher quality sleep, more exercise, and healthier diet (H1B). Aim 2: Examine effects of RS on CSPs' delivery of CM health programming to the community. Hypotheses: RS will be associated both with reduced threats to CSPs leaving the workforce, including higher satisfaction with work, greater agency, and lower burnout (H2A), and with a higher number of community members reached for CM health programming, as indexed by number of days CSP worked, number of health-related events offered by CSPs, community attendance at events, and retention of community members across multi-day programs (H2B)."

This situation is related to higher morbidity and mortality. There is a growing need to determine effective interventions that address these situations, since sometimes pharmacological options are limited in these patients. Physical activity (AF) and social relationships in the elderly are linked to physical and mental health. Being able to do some physical or recreational activity will help them face this stage of life with more optimism and relate to others in a healthy and independent way, however, few studies have evaluated their effectiveness in our territory. - Objectives: To evaluate whether a 4 month AF group program and the visit to know socio-cultural entities improve the emotional, social and quality of life situation in a sample of people over 64 years of age with anxiety, depression, social isolation or solitude And measure whether adherence to AF and the linkage to sociocultural entities is maintained after the intervention has taken place. - Methodology: Design: Multicentre, randomized, two-group clinical trial, of 1 year follow-up. Study population: Patients over 64 years of age assigned to primary care teams (EAP) from different locations: Sant Joan de Vilatorrada, S\u00faria and Manresa 2. Inclusion criteria: To meet criteria of depression or anxiety at the time of the study, score> 12 on the Beck Depression Scale and / or score> 10 on the GAD-7 Scale (General Anxiety Disorder) and that Present a score <32 on the steps of DUKE-UNC-11. A randomization of between 44 and 56 patients will be performed at each participant EAP. Half will be allocated to the control group (GC) and half to the intervention group (GI). The intervention group will participate in a group AF program for 4 months. It will consist of 60 minutes of walking sessions 2 days a week. Also once a month, coinciding with the walk, you will visit some sociocultural municipal equipment to promote a community connection. . Main measures: Response to the intervention or clinical remission of depression (Escalera de Beck), and / or anxiety (Escala GAD-7), improvement of social support (DUKE-UNC) and quality of life (EuroQol) . Secondary measures: Adherence to the AF (VREM questionnaire (Spanish Reduced Version of the Minnesota Free Time Questionnaire in Minnesota)), and linkage to sociocultural entities once the intervention has been completed. The assessments will be made at 0, 4, 8 and 12 months."

Many people with SCI also experience challenges with social connection, which may make engaging in physical activities more difficult. The investigators are offering a new online application designed specifically for people with SCI. The purpose of the research is to develop and evaluate a new online app, called SCI-Lynx, that would allow people with SCI to connect with other people and support each other in their physical activity, exercise, or other health or personal goals over a one-month period. This research will also evaluate how SCI-Lynx affects self-efficacy and social support for exercise and provide new information on changing physical activity participation and social connection in people with SCI."

            "Background: Although the health benefits of physical activity are well established, it remains challenging for people to adopt a more active lifestyle. Mobile health (mHealth) interventions can be effective tools to promote physical activity and reduce sedentary behavior. Promising results have been obtained by using gamification techniques as behavior change strategies, especially when they were tailored toward an individual's preferences and goals; yet, it remains unclear how goals could be personalized to effectively promote health behaviors. Objective: In this study, the investigators aim to evaluate the impact of personalized goal setting in the context of gamified mHealth interventions. The investigators hypothesize that interventions suggesting health goals that are tailored based on end users' (self-reported) current and desired capabilities will be more engaging than interventions with generic goals. Methods: The study was designed as a 2-arm randomized intervention trial. Participants were recruited among staff members of Noorderkempen governmental organization. They participated in an 8-week digital health promotion campaign that was especially designed to promote walks, bike rides, and sports sessions. Using an mHealth app, participants could track their performance on two social leaderboards: a leaderboard displaying the individual scores of participants and a leaderboard displaying the average scores per organizational department. The mHealth app also provided a news feed that showed when other participants had scored points. Points could be collected by performing any of the 6 assigned tasks (eg, walk for at least 2000 m). The level of complexity of 3 of these 6 tasks was updated every 2 weeks by changing either the suggested task intensity or the suggested frequency of the task. The 2 intervention arms-with participants randomly assigned-consisted of a personalized treatment that tailored the complexity parameters based on participants' self-reported capabilities and goals and a control treatment where the complexity parameters were set generically based on national guidelines. Measures were collected from the mHealth app as well as from intake and posttest surveys and analyzed using hierarchical linear models. Note: Eindhoven University of Technology is not an official GCP sponsor. Hence, this study is not a medical clinical trial."

            "Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) has become a more prominent disease in the US population, with more than 3 million adults in the US affected. To manage this disease effectively, physicians tend to need to have a multidisciplinary approach as there are many psychosocial implications of chronic gastrointestinal illnesses like Crohn's and Ulcerative Colitis. Recent literature has supported the desire for telemedicine and remote physiologic monitoring for such patients to allow the patient to be more active in their treatments and make physicians more aware of what their bodies are doing from a physiologic perspective. Whoop is a new device founded in 2011 that has grown in popularity for its ability to accurately measure sleep patterns, resting heart rate, and heart rate variability (HRV) amongst other various physiologic measurements. Newer literature supports that depressed heart rate variability can correlate to disease flares such as heart failure exacerbations. The study investigators proposed that using remote physiologic monitoring in the IBD population along with their symptoms can help predict disease severity and potentially lead to earlier interventions if correlations are accurate. It can also spark interest in the younger generation for remote physiologic monitoring and telemedicine, which is believed to be beneficial in patients with chronic illnesses."

Cold water immersion (CWI) is considered the gold standard for the treatment of exertional heat stroke (EHS) and has been shown to increase survival rates to 100% with the implementation of CWI best practices. However, in a field setting other cooling strategies have been developed to aid in the prevention of EHS and other heat-related illnesses. One such proposed strategy is a portable hand cooling device that does not require the use of ice or water.

However, PSG is costly, and tends to be burdensome in terms of set-up time and invasiveness during sleep. Wearable sleep-monitoring devices could prove to be a more practical alternative to PSG. Additionally, while EKG leads are typically what is utilized to measure heart rate (HR) and heart rate variability (HRV) throughout the night in a PSG set-up, every day-use HR monitors are also beneficial for individuals to evaluate their cardiovascular activity during different types of physical activities (including every day activities, exercise, and sleep), as well as their heart's ability to \"recover\" from a given activity. The investigators propose to study the effect of the WHOOP Strap 2.0 device on sleep perception and perform a methodological study to validate the accuracy of the the WHOOP Strap 2.0 device when measuring HR accuracy and HRV accuracy, and sleep quality and quantity with respect to PSG in healthy volunteers with no self-reported sleep disorders or debilitating medical conditions."

            "Resident wellness and physician burnout are under the spotlight more and more as data begins to show that there is a point of diminishing return on the number of hours in training. In 2003, resident work hours were restricted to less than 80 hours per week averaged over 4 weeks. This change was implemented in response to the robust body of evidence that increased work hours leads to decreased sleep, which in turn leads to medical errors and depression. These factors directly and indirectly lead to worse outcomes for patients. In residency, it is difficult objectively to assess when residents are beginning to experience burnout and depression. The investigators propose a study to determine whether tracking of certain heart rate parameters (resting heart rate and heart rate variability) as well as sleep can correlate to subjective assessment of resident wellness, burnout and depression. The investigators will also compare these measures to biomarkers of stress, such as salivary cortisol. The results of this study may lead to improved understanding of what truly causes burnout and may be an eventual target for intervention to help improve short- and long-term outcomes for resident physicians as well as their patients."

            "Facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (FSHD) is a devastating progressive muscle dystrophy. There is no treatment. FSHD is generally characterized by asymmetrical weakness and wasting of facial, shoulder girdle and upper arm muscles followed by weakness of muscles of the trunk and lower extremities, but disease severity varies widely between patients. Relatively long periods of stability are interspersed with short periods of potentially steep decline, leading overall to a slow but unpredictable rate of progression. Different genotypes underlying FSHD have been identified, but they result in highly similar phenotypes and at the molecular level converge on undue expression of the transcription factor, DUX4, in skeletal muscle, which is thought to (ultimately) lead to muscle wasting due to inflammation, apoptosis, and oxidative stress. There is no approved treatment, although various companies are engaged in FSHD drug discovery and development aimed in particular at reducing DUX4 expression. Multiple treatment options are currently under development in both preclinical and early clinical stages. However, these efforts face significant challenges in the path to regulatory approval. Because of the slow and variable rate of progression of FSHD, evidencing a significant treatment response will be cumbersome using only the existing measurements of muscle function. The successful development of these investigative treatments for FSHD is therefore highly dependent on the availability of validated disease and treatment biomarkers to monitor disease progression and response to treatment, respectively. To date, no such validated biomarkers exist. This study is important for four reasons: 1. Clinical testing of FSHD drug candidates requires the availability of clinical biomarkers that (a) change relatively rapidly over time; (b) allow for identification of fast progressors; and (c) correlate with \"gold standard\", but slowly changing, clinical severity and/or functional scores. This study is a first step in that direction as it seeks to explore if the investigational digital technologies described below are able to generate single or composite variables that (cross-sectionally) distinguish FSHD patients from controls. If identified, such variables will be tested as putative clinical FSHD biomarkers in a follow-up longitudinal study with FSHD patients. 2. Patient testimonies indicate that living with FSHD means living with pain, fatigue, social isolation, and anxiety about the future. This study provides the first-ever opportunity to gather objective, real-world data about the impact of FSHD on daily life. 3. Regulators have already indicated that Real-World Data (RWD) is a top strategic priority for their drug reviews. This study aims to fill this gap by gathering RWD about the physical and social activities of FSHD patients in comparison with controls. This way we aim to find (composite) scores that correlate with selected severity and functional scores and additionally distinguish FSHD patients from controls. 4. This study offers an opportunity to expand the spectrum of diseases in which RWD may be used as (a basis for) clinical outcome measures. A successful outcome of this study may support testing the MORE platform in other muscular dystrophies as well."

It should be the overarching goal to allocate sparse health care resources to those most at need and to simultaneously avoid unnecessary blocking of resources by clinically unjustified hospitalizations. Individuals with preexisting cardiovascular conditions are at the highest risk of health deterioration, even at younger age. Objective criteria for hospitalization are not immediately available in a outpatient settings. Hence, hospitalization and emergency medical contact is often triggered by subjectively interpreted symptoms. The goal of this project is thus to improve the availability of objective measurements in the outpatient setting by means of an innovative, smartwatch mediated telemedicine approach. To achieve this goal, the investigators will conduct a randomized clinical trial comparing a smartwatch based telemedicine intervention with standard of care. The intervention group will receive regular objective measurements of heart rate, ECG, and SpO2 and will get access to a 24/7 medical care hotline for consultation. The investigators hypothesize that the intervention group will benefit by a significant reduction in unnecessary hospitalizations and unplanned emergency medicine contacts."

Secondary aim is to examine the association between incidence of migraine headaches and sleep metrics with time transitions. Participants will be provided with a Withings non-wearable/contactless sleep tracker, which will be placed under the mattress for a period of 4 weeks (2 weeks before and 2 weeks after) during daylight saving time transition in March, 2023. Withings Health Mate app will be downloaded to the participant's smartphone to collect Sleep Data. Headache diaries will be provided to log the details of the migraines during the study period.

It aggravates morbidity and cardio-metabolic mortality and is responsible for accidents related to vigilance disorders. It is estimated that 80% of SAS cases are not diagnosed and therefore not treated. It is however impracticable to propose a diagnostic test of polygraphy (PG) or polysomnography (PSG) to every patient because of the cost and insufficient availability of these exams. It would therefore be useful to carry out a screening test before directing the patient to a complete test. Several simplified polygraph systems with 2 or 3 channels have been proposed (nasal cannula, oximetry, heart rate) but they generally record only one night and remain intrusive enough to perturb the sleep. The Withings Sleep is a non-contact device, along with an airbag placed under the mattress, which allows screening of SAS from four signals: movement, breathing, heart rate and snoring. The objective of the present study is to validate the diagnostic performance of the Withings Sleep for the detection of SAS compared to PSG."
