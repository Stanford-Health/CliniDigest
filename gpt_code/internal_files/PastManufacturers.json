            "The prevalence of adults with overweight (50%) and obesity (15%) reached high number in Belgium. Important lifestyle behaviors, i.e. sleep, sedentary time (SB), and physical activity (PA) subdivided into light physical activity (LPA) and moderate to vigorous physical activity (MVPA), have shown an impact on overweight and obesity characteristics (e.g. adiposity). However, these behaviors have often been investigated separately. Therefore, a recent shift in research emphasizes the importance of considering these behaviors as part of a 24-hour day. Since these adults can benefit from an optimal 24-hour composition as part of a healthy lifestyle, it may be interesting to investigate the 24-hour movement composition among these adults. In addition, exploring different personal determinants, environmental determinants, and cardiometabolic markers will provide meaningful insights in developing an intervention."

The two different approaches to PA in schools are based on; 1. 'Embodied cognition' focusing on fine and gross motor PA closely related and highly relevant to the learning task. 'Embodied cognition' builds upon theory suggesting that movement and performing actions leads to the construction of enhanced mental representations e.g. strengthening memory recall. This intervention is called 'MOVE & LEARN'. 2. 'Exercise and cognition theory focusing mainly on gross motor movements (e.g. aerobic exercise) which is not relevant to the learning task and with no temporal connection to the learning task. The assumed positive effects are explained by physiological adaptations leading to changes in cognition, which potentially can affect AP. This intervention is called 'RUN, JUMP & FUN'. Based on this, the aims of ACTIVE SCHOOL are to develop two types of school-based PA interventions in close collaboration with the participating teachers, students and schools AND to investigate the effects of these two interventions on AP in a large school-based cluster-RCT with an intervention length of one school year. The ACTIVE SCHOOL study consists of three phases: Phase 1) Development of the intervention, Phase 2) Pilot testing and, Pase 3) A three-armed randomized controlled trial (RCT). Participants will be students in 3rd grade (8-10 years-old) and their teachers/school pedagogues. The development phase started in August 2021 and is still ongoing.

Therefore, the research team intends to address some of the scientific challenges proposed, which represent clear gaps in the current knowledge. The investigators propose a randomized controlled trial conducted during all neoadjuvant treatment duration that aims to evaluate and compare the effects of two different exercise protocols (aerobic and resistance training) against a relaxation control group on Ki-67% changes as the main outcome in breast cancer patients. Secondary outcomes will be body composition; resting metabolic rate; physical fitness; quality of life, fatigue, depression/anxiety; accelerometry data (physical activity levels, sedentary time); sleep quality; tumor biology (size, hypoxia, and immune profile); glycemic, lipid, and inflammatory profile. This project will help not only researchers with the design of future exercise intervention protocols but will also help exercise physiologists in the decision-making process when defining training programs. Moreover, the investigators expect that this research program will encourage more cancer patients to exercise. The team expects that patients with breast cancer engaging in structured exercise will show a more marked decrease in Ki-67, tumor size, and hypoxia and increase the tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) compared to controls. The investigators anticipate a more noticeable decrease in the preoperative endocrine prognostic index (PEPI) score and in the Residual Breast Cancer (RCB) in both training groups (respectively with hormonal and chemotherapy). Also, frequent declines in physical fitness are expected to be mitigated in exercisers. It is hypothesize that aerobic training will ameliorate cardiorespiratory fitness and fat mass, while the effects of resistance training will be more relevant for muscle strength, muscle mass, and bone health. Both exercise groups will show greater improvements in quality of life, fatigue, depression, anxiety, and sleep quality. Regarding glycemic, lipid, and inflammatory profiles, the investigators expect to see more favorable changes in both training groups, with a more evident decrease in fasting glucose and insulin, HbA1c%, total and LDL-cholesterol, and triglycerides, and the increase in HDL-cholesterol. The increase in C-reactive protein (CRP), tumor necrosis factor -\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1), interleukin-6 (IL-6), IL-8, IL-1\u03b2, IL-1ra, and insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) and the decrease in brain-derived neutrotophic factor (BDNF), IL-12p70, IL-10, oncostatin M will be smaller in exercise groups."

The scientific research on the relationship between fundamental movement skills, physical activity, physical fitness and executive function in preschoolers remains to be explored. Objective: The purpose of this study was to examine the cross-sectional relationship between fundamental movement skills, physical activity, physical fitness and executive function in preschool children while controlling for potential confounding variables, examine the prospective influence (independent and interactive role) of preschooler's fundamental movement skills, physical activity and physical fitness on executive function, observe the preschoolers' fundamental movement skills, physical activity, physical fitness and executive function changes with age, and investigate gender and age differences in preschoolers' fundamental movement skills, physical activity, physical fitness and executive function. Method: The proposed study consists of two phases, phase 1 is a cross-sectional study. Five hundred and five children aged 3-5 years will be recruited. The Test of Gross Motor Development Third Edition (TGMD-3) was used to assess children's fundamental movement skills. Preschool children's physical activity was monitored by accelerometer ActiGraph GT3X-BT. Physical fitness was tested using handgrip, 4*10m shuttle run, 20m shuttle run, 30s sit-ups, sit and reach, and balance beam.

However, the benefits of PR tend to decline over time and there is currently no strong evidence that patients translate those benefits into a more active lifestyle. There is an urgent need for evidence-based interventions to promote physical activity (PA) participation, whilst maintaining PR positive effects in the long-term. Community-based PA interventions adjusted to the local context, as well as patients' needs and preferences, might be a key strategy to meet this target.

Women who suffer an acute coronary event are more likely than men to be physically inactive, have lower exercise capacity, and die in the next year. The standard cardiac rehabilitation (CR) programs do not meet women's needs. There is a need to address these issues to increase participation in CR. The main purpose of this project is to evaluate the effects of high-intensity interval training (HIIT) compared to moderate-intensity continuous exercise training (MICE) on exercise capacity and quality of life in women with CHD. Positive results of this study will fill the gap in knowledge in exercise training, levels of motivation, self-efficacy and enjoyment following HIIT vs. MICE in women with CHD."

The 4 month (16-wk) GOAL intervention has 3 components: (1) After-school GOAL Club: 26 events (2 d/wk; 120 min/event/day; 13 wks due to no club during 3 school break wks) for boys and girls to engage in physical activity (PA) and healthy eating/cooking activities; (2) Three parent-adolescent meetings (1st meeting at each school; also conducted synchronously via Zoom to increase convenience for parents who are not able to meet in-person at the school for various reasons); 2nd and 3rd meetings will be video-recorded and delivered asynchronously to accommodate and meet the needs of busy parents who have varying schedules due to work, home, and other responsibilities): to empower parents to assist adolescents with PA and healthy eating/cooking; and (3) GOAL social networking website: private website (already developed) for parents to learn about healthy eating and physical activity, network with other parents, and share with each other about how they helped their adolescent(s) increase PA and diet quality during a prior week. The purpose of this individual randomized controlled trial (unit of assignment is adolescent) is to evaluate the effect of GOAL on decreasing cardiovascular disease risk factors (high percent body fat, overweight/obesity, low cardiovascular fitness), improving quality of life; and increasing motivation, self-efficacy, and social support to increase moderate-to-vigorous PA and diet quality among underserved adolescents (5th-8th grade) throughout the state of Michigan. All interested adolescents who meet eligibility criteria and have parental consent will be included. We are including all interested students and not only those who have a high BMI (e.g., BMI z-score \u22650 [\u226550th percentile]), in order to avoid social stigma(s) discouraging adolescents from participating.

On the other hand, some older adults may not feel at risk for falling, but do have a physical risk of falling. This study is being done to test a preventative, in-home exercise program (called PEER) which may allow older adults to improve balance, align the perceived risk for falling with the physical risk for falling, and prevent falls. Participants will be asked to participate in this study for approximately 9 months. This study has three specific aims: 1. Examine differences in balance, fall risk, and physical activity after program completion, follow-up 3 months and 6 months between older adults (OAs) in the Physio-fEedback Exercise pRogram (PEER) intervention and OAs in attention control (AC) condition. 2. Explore differences in exercise adherence and the proportion of shifting in fall risk appraisal and negative self-perception on aging after program completion, follow-up 3 months and 6 months between OAs in the PEER intervention and OAs in AC condition. 3. Explore participants' experiences with the PEER intervention and potential barriers to access and adoption of the technology-based PEER intervention to inform future research. Participants will be asked to participate in this study for approximately 9 months.

The project converges multiple disciplines (e.g. public health, informatics, law) and researchers with proven expertise in these fields to provide comprehensive and innovative answers. 478 children (6 schools) aged 6-12years old will participate in this cluster-randomised trial, having schools as the unit of randomisation, assigned into intervention (239-3schools) and the control arm (239 - 3 schools). This project will perform a social listening (online and offline) and bottom-up approach to tackling NCDs, focusing on health literacy and health promotion and recognising children's systems in daily life (e.g. family, teachers). Stakeholders' involvement goes far beyond a merely consultative approach; the researchers are committed to a genuine codevelopment process. Data collection includes sociodemographics, health literacy and infodemic resilience, dietary intake and children's 24-h movement behaviour (e.g. accelerometry), anthropometry (e.g. weight, height and waist circumference) and blood pressure. Data collection will occur at baseline and after the intervention (follow-up, 6 months after the beginning of the intervention). Expected outputs and outcomes include the creation of a model for characterising NCDs and health topics based on artificial intelligence techniques (e.g. deep learning, and social network analysis methods); improved health literacy and infodemic resilience of children, families and teachers; enhanced children's lifestyles (e.g. dietary intake, 24-h movement behaviour); reduction of NCDs' physical risk factors (e.g. overweight, raised blood pressure); feasible intervention program about health promotion and NCDs' prevention for school-aged children with vulnerabilities, and advocacy- policies about health promotion and NCDs' prevention."

However, ageing is accompanied by cognitive decline which affects people's daily functioning and, if it develops to dementia, their ability to live independently. By 2050, the number of people who develop dementia will triple to 152 million. The aim of this project is to precisely examine how physical activity (PA) and sleep, both modifiable lifestyle factors, are related to cognitive function and which role they can play in optimal cognitive ageing. To do so, a longitudinal study will be conducted, with objective measures of PA, sleep and cognition in midlife and older adults. This project will meet the current need for longitudinal studies with objective PA and sleep data, as well as provide, for the first time, in-depth information on associations of type of PA (aerobic vs muscle strengthening), characteristics of sleep (quality vs quantity) with specific cognitive domains (executive function and memory). Furthermore, although PA and sleep are related, the behavioural dynamics of combinations of PA and sleep on cognition has never been studied before. To fill this gap, these relationships will be examined with an innovative statistical approach, looking at data across a 24-hour period. The resulting deeper understanding of the precise relationship between PA, sleep and cognitive function will contribute to the development of preventive interventions for maintaining cognitive health at older age."

            "Children from rural communities are at greater risk for obesity than children from more urban communities. However, some children are resilient to obesity despite greater exposure to obesogenic influences in rural communities (e.g., fewer community-level physical activity or healthy eating resources). Identifying factors that promote this resiliency could inform obesity prevention. Eating habits are learned through reinforcement (e.g., hedonic, familial environment), the process through which environmental food cues become valued and influence behavior. Therefore, understanding individual differences in reinforcement learning is essential to uncovering the causes of obesity. Preclinical models have identified two reinforcement learning phenotypes that may have translational importance for understanding excess consumption in humans: 1) goal-tracking-environmental cues have predictive value; and 2) sign-tracking-environmental cues have predictive and hedonic value (i.e., incentive salience). Sign-tracking is associated with poorer attentional control, greater impulsivity, and lower prefrontal cortex (PFC) engagement in response to reward cues. This parallels neurocognitive deficits observed in pediatric obesity (i.e., worse impulsivity, lower PFC food cue reactivity). The proposed research aims to determine if reinforcement learning phenotype (i.e., sign- and goal-tracking) is 1) associated with adiposity due to its influence on neural food cue reactivity and 2) associated with reward-driven overconsumption and meal intake due to its influence on eating behaviors. The investigators hypothesize that goal-tracking will promote resiliency to obesity due to: 1) reduced attribution of incentive salience and greater PFC engagement to food cues; and 2) reduced reward-driven overconsumption. Finally, the investigators hypothesize reinforcement learning phenotype will be associated due to its influence on eating behaviors associated with overconsumption (e.g., larger bites, faster bite rat and eating sped). To test this hypothesis, the investigators will enroll 76, 8-9-year-old children, half with healthy weight and half with obesity based on Centers for Disease Control definitions. Methods will include computer tasks to assess reinforcement learning, dual x-ray absorptiometry to assess adiposity, and neural food cue reactivity from functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS)."

The number of long-term survivors is increasing rapidly due to improving accuracy of the detecting methods, the early diagnosis and advances in cancer treatment. The International Consortium for Health Outcomes Measurement Initiative described upper limb (UL) function as the health outcome that matters most for breast cancer survivors (BCS). 50% of BCS at 6 months post-radiotherapy suffer from of decreased UL function, i.e. difficulties in performing activities of daily living with the upper limb. Patients experiencing UL dysfunctions and other problems are less likely to be physically active. Given that physical inactivity is associated with an increased risk of mortality after breast cancer, taking away the barriers to physical activity (e.g. UL dysfunctions) is very important. Identifying these factors contributing to chronic UL dysfunction is important in terms of identifying targets for prospective evaluation and specific treatment approaches at specific time points during breast cancer treatment.

            "Cable cars are means of transportation with urban mobility benefits for vulnerable populations living in areas with geographic barriers. Despite their popularity, there is no evidence of cable cars' potential health effects. TransMicable, located in \"Ciudad Bolivar\", Bogota, Colombia will open in late-2018 presenting an unprecedented opportunity to assess the health impacts and accessibility improvements. The investigators aim is to assess the effect of theTransMiCable implementation on social determinants of health (social capital, employment, crime, transport, microenvironment pollution, built environment), healthy behaviors (leisure and transport physical activity) and health outcomes (health-related quality of life, respiratory diseases and homicides). The investigators are conducting a controlled quasi-experimental pre-post study with six elements: 1) The co-construction of a conceptual framework using a causal loop diagram with stakeholders of multiple sectors. 2) A (non-intervention - intervention) quantitative study of social capital, community participation, travel time, costs, demand, modal choice, physical activity and health-related quality of life using repeated in-person questionnaire, anthropometric measurements and physical activity using accelerometers. 3) A transport trajectory study in a subsample of the population of the quantitative study using a mobile application to track journeys. 4) A subsample of environment evaluations 5) Our Voice in the Neighborhood qualitative study to address the potential change in perceptions of the neighborhood using Citizen Science \"by the people\" involving the community and local public and private stakeholders and 6) A Secondary-data analysis of Crime and Respiratory diseases using time trends from official surveillance systems for homicides and acute respiratory diseases. The investigators' main hypothesis are 1) There is an increase in the Social Capital and Quality of life indicators in the TransMicable target area after the implementation when compared to other neighborhoods without TransMiCable. 2) There is a significant decrease in travel time and cost for trips to downtown Bogota and an increase in the total number of trips for residents of \"Ciudad Bolivar\" neighborhoods with TransMiCable, after the implementation of TransMiCable when compared to other neighborhoods without TransMiCable in the locality of \"San Cristobal\". 3) There is a significant shift in modal choice for the resident of \"Ciudad Bolivar\" from informal transport service to the TransMiCable system with a positive association in terms of proximity to TransMiCable stations. 4) Most TransMiCable users are former informal bus transit and formal bus feeder users. While most users will access TransMiCable by walking, some living further from stations will take informal transport services to access to TransMiCable. 5) There is a reduction in the microenvironment pollution around the target area of TransMiCable when compared to the control area. 6) There is a change in the perception of the neighborhood for residents of the target area of TransMiCable when compared to the control area. 7) There is a significant decrease in the prevalence of homicides and acute respiratory diseases in the area of the TransMiCable implementation in comparison to the control area without TransMiCable. The results of this study will allow us to understand baseline dynamics, while, in the long-term, allowing us to assess the changes in travel and health behaviors."

To maintain adherence and motivation throughout a 6-month training intervention, weekly supervision of the training is needed. For this study, it is hypothesized that a supervised exercise intervention, in addition to a motivational counseling intervention and usual care, will improve muscle strength compared with unsupervised home-based training (active controls)."

            "Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a type of irregular heart rhythm due to electrical signal disturbances of the heart. It is a very common arrhythmia and the risk of developing AF increases with age and with other risk factors such as diabetes, high blood pressure, and underlying heart disease. The main complications of AF are heart failure and stroke. However, studies have shown that restoration of normal rhythm does not reduce these complications. Rather, these complications are mitigated by controlling the heart rate and using blood thinners to prevent stroke. Symptoms secondary to AF can occur due to the irregular heart rate and poor contraction in the atria, the top chambers of the heart. These symptoms include shortness of breath, fatigue, reduced exercise tolerance, and palpitations. Restoring sinus rhythm can sometimes alleviate these symptoms. Given that studies to date have not shown a difference in hard clinical endpoints between rate and rhythm control strategies, the decision to proceed with rhythm control depends on the patient symptom burden. Rhythm control strategies in patients with persistent AF include cardioversion back to sinus rhythm with long-term recurrence prevention via anti-arrhythmic drugs (AADs) or catheter ablation. However, many studies of these procedures omit a sham placebo control arm. No atrial fibrillation procedural intervention has been compared to a sham procedure. The cardioversion procedure can easily be compared to a \"sham\" alternative, as it is non-invasive with an expected response within days-to-weeks. Thus, a cardioversion versus \"sham\" cardioversion trial will allow us to truly assess the impact of a rhythm-control strategy on QOL. It is hypothesized that cardioversion of atrial fibrillation leads to significant improvement in quality of life (QOL) compared to sham cardioversion. Understanding the true QOL impact of sinus rhythm restoration in patients with persistent AF is of significant importance in guiding strategies for the management of AF. Hence, by evaluating what the true effect of cardioversion on QOL in this blinded study, we can better understand the role of medical management and AF ablation in our patients and assess resource allocation to these procedures."

            "After a 30-year decline, heart disease is projected to increase up to 18% by 2030. Participation rates in cardiac rehabilitation remain extremely low and hopeless individuals are less likely to participate. This innovative study has the potential to advance science, improve patient care, and improve patient outcomes by demonstrating the effectiveness of the Heart Up! program to increase physical activity and reduce hopelessness in patients with heart disease. Hopelessness is associated with a 3.4 times increased risk of mortality or nonfatal myocardial infarction in patients with ischemic heart disease (IHD), independent of depression. Hopelessness has been identified in 27-52% of patients with IHD and can persist for up to 12 months after hospital discharge. Hopelessness, a negative outlook and sense of helplessness toward the future, can be a temporary response to an event (state) or a habitual outlook (trait). Hopelessness is associated with decreased physical functioning and lower physical activity (PA) levels in individuals with IHD. While research has investigated strategies to increase PA among IHD patients in general, the study team is the only group to design an intervention to promote PA specifically in hopeless IHD patients. The purpose of this randomized controlled trial is to establish the effectiveness of our 6-week mHealth intervention (Heart Up!) to promote increased PA in hopeless patients with IHD. A total of 225 hopeless IHD patients will be enrolled from a large community teaching hospital in the Midwest. Patients will be randomized (75 per group) to one of three groups: 1) motivational social support (MSS) from a nurse, 2) MSS from a nurse with additional significant other support (SOS), or 3) attention control (AC). It is hypothesized that 1) The MSS with SOS group will have the greatest increase in average minutes of moderate to vigorous PA per day at 8 and 24 weeks as compared to the MSS only or AC groups; 2) Greater increase in minutes of moderate to vigorous PA per day will be associated with decreased state hopelessness levels from baseline to weeks 8 and 24; and 3) Increased social support and increased motivation will mediate the effects of Heart Up! on a greater increase in moderate to vigorous PA at 8 and 24 weeks. The findings from this study could transform care for IHD patients who are hopeless by promoting self-management of important PA goals that can contribute to better health outcomes."

            "Dementia is the main cause of disability in older adults, currently affecting about 50 million people world-wide with this number estimated to triple in the next 30 years. In MET-FINGER, we aim to understand whether the FINGER 2.0 multidomain intervention, combining healthy lifestyle changes and a drug for diabetes (metformin), may help reduce the risk of dementia and improve health and independence among older adults. The study primary objective is to test the effect of the intervention, compared to healthy lifestyle advice, on the change in cognition, measured as a composite score including 14 of neuropsychological/cognitive tests. The secondary objective is to test the intervention effect on change in individual cognitive domains, functioning level, and risk factors for dementia (e.g., lifestyle, medical, and psychosocial). To this aim, a range of personal/health-related data and blood samples, will be collected. Potential interactions between metformin and lifestyle changes; potential disease-modifying effects; and feasibility of the metformin + lifestyle combination will be explored. 600 older people with risk factors for dementia, but without dementia/substantial cognitive impairment, will be recruited in the United Kingdom, Finland, and Sweden (at least 50% with higher genetic risk of Alzheimer's Disease/dementia based on the Apolipoprotein E (APOE) gene). Participants will be randomly assigned 1:1 to either a self-guided multidomain lifestyle intervention or to the FINGER 2.0 multidomain lifestyle-based intervention. Outcome assessors will be blinded to group allocation. Within the FINGER 2.0 intervention group, participants at increased risk of diabetes, will be randomly assigned 1:1:1 to either the metformin 2000mg/day, metformin 1000mg/day, or placebo group (double blinded). The intervention duration is 24 months. The lifestyle intervention includes four main components: physical exercise, diet, brain training and health checks. In the self-guided group, participants will create their own program, based on health advice and recommendations which will be provided during the study. In the FINGER 2.0 intervention group, participants will receive intensive lifestyle guidance, and participate in structured activities, which will be as tailored as possible on each person's daily habits and needs. Over the 2-year study period, all participants will attend four assessment visits: baseline, 6-, 12-, and 24-months."

            "A healthy lifestyle has proved beneficial health effects in managing type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Important lifestyle behaviors, i.e. sleep, sedentary time (SB), and physical activity (PA) subdivided into light physical activity (LPA) and moderate to vigorous physical activity (MVPA), have shown an impact on T2DM disease-specific characteristics (e.g. glycemic control). However, these behaviors have often been investigated separately. Therefore, a recent shift in research emphasizes the importance of considering these behaviors as part of a 24-hour day. Since T2DM patients can benefit from an optimal 24-hour composition as part of a healthy lifestyle, it may be interesting to investigate the 24-hour movement composition among these T2DM patients over time. Moreover, exploring associations with different personal determinants, environmental determinants, and cardiometabolic markers will provide meaningful insights in developing recommendations and creating an intervention."

It is known that people with ILD are highly inactive and sedentary, and in a severe stage of the disease, these people spend most of the time at home, increasing dependency on others, and decrease HRQoL. Physical activity is a cost-effective intervention, which increases the HRQoL, exercise capacity and ability to perform activities of daily living in people with chronic respiratory diseases. However, few home-based physical activity programmes are available, especially in people with ILD. Thus, it is urgent to develop innovative models of PA, closer to patients and adjusted to the patients' routines, to engage and change patients' physical activity levels, enhancing HRQoL. iLiFE might be promising as it focuses on establishing new behaviours, within selected contexts to stimulate home-based PA.

Despite the accumulation of scientific evidence supporting the benefits of physical activity, obese and diabetic people remain insufficiently active and current programs struggle to engage and sustain physical activity of patients over long periods of time. It is therefore urgent to develop interventions that can effectively change individuals' behavior. In this context, \"e-health\" interventions and gamification appear to be a particularly promising avenue to improve physical activity and reduce attrition rates of current programs. This clinical trial aim to test the effectiveness of a digital intervention based on gamification and teamwork in comparison to a supervised physical activity program. The investigators hypothesized that the intervention will be efficient by the development of a self-determined motivation through the process of gamification on the one hand. On the other hand, through the in-group collaboration with other people who share the same stigmatized criteria that will help participants to overcome weight stigmas, acting generally as physical activity barriers."

            "Aging is the primary risk factor for cardiovascular diseases (CVD), the number one cause of death in developed societies. Systolic blood pressure (SBP) increase with age and is a key intermediary factor linking aging to increased CVD risk. The primary mechanisms underlying the age-associated increase in SBP is stiffening of the large elastic arteries, which is mediated by increases in oxidative stress, inflammation, and vascular smooth muscle tone. Regular caloric restriction is effective at lowering SBP in middle-aged and older adults; however, adherence to caloric restriction is poor and may be detrimental to normal weight older adults due to reduced skeletal muscle mass and bone mineral density. Therefore, identification of more practical alternative interventions that mimic the beneficial effects of caloric restriction, with stronger adherence and less risk of adverse consequences, is of significant biomedical importance. Nicotinamide riboside is a naturally occurring precursor of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+), a critical mediator of the beneficial effects of caloric restriction, and therefore a novel caloric restriction mimetic compound. We recently completed the first pilot study of nicotinamide riboside supplementation in healthy middle-aged and older adults and demonstrated that 6 weeks of supplementation decreased systolic blood pressure (SBP) by 8 mmHg in individuals with baseline SBP of 120-139 mmHg (elevated SBP/stage 1 hypertension) compared with placebo, and lowered arterial stiffness, a strong independent predictor of CVD and related morbidity and mortality. As a next translational step, we will conduct a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind clinical trial to further assess the safety and efficacy of oral nicotinamide riboside (3 months vs placebo) for decreasing SBP and arterial stiffness in middle-aged and older men and women with SBP between 120 and 139 mmHg at baseline."

            "Stroke is the third leading cause of disability worldwide. Women present a higher incidence of this pathology and prevalence of its risk factors. Similarly, after stroke, women have a poorer functional outcome, higher rates of institutionalization and greater dependence on activities of daily living. People who have suffered a stroke are at increased risk of cardiovascular disease, with an estimated one-third of stroke survivors suffering a new event in the following 5 years. Current scientific literature recommends the promotion of physical activity (PA) and exercise for the prevention of stroke and its sequelae. However, stroke survivors are often insufficiently active. Therefore, changing their behavior with respect to PA and sedentary lifestyle is fundamental. Moreover, gender perspective, should also taken into account. Thus, our aims are to study whether there are differences in women with chronic stroke sequelae compared to men in: 1) the amount of sitting time and its context, as well as the time spent in different intensities of PA; 2) the reduction of sitting time and its effect on health after the completion of the PA self-management program and sedentary lifestyle developed in this project; 3) the presence of sarcopenia, osteoporosis and the state of frailty. To achieve these objectives, the lifestyle habits of 128 subjects (64 women) who live in the community and have chronic sequelae of stroke (\u2265 6 months) will be evaluated. In addition, possible differences in the study variables will be verified with control people without sequelae of stroke. Moreover, in order to reduce the risks of stroke survivors, a program of self-management of PA and sedentary lifestyle will be developed. This program will be carried out through several sessions spread over six months that will incorporate: education, goal setting, identification of barriers, self-control and feedback. The feasibility of this intervention will be determined by examining compliance, duration, utility, and safety. At least 64 of the previously studied subjects will participate in this program, analyzing whether it favors the reduction of sitting time and its effect on health thanks to the measurement of different physical capacities. The differences between men and women in response to the program will be determined. Finally, we will explore whether the effect of the program is greater when it is implemented in the subacute than in the chronic phase."

            "The prevalence of obesity in adolescents is remarkably high, with 38.7% of youth 12-15 years of age and 41.5% of 16-19 year olds meeting criteria for overweight or obesity. Behavioral weight control interventions for adolescents have had limited impact on this field and there is considerably more that needs to be done. Notably, adolescents who have difficulty managing their feelings have been found to consume higher caloric foods and report greater amounts of sedentary time. Poor emotion management among adolescents has also been associated with more rapid weight gain and higher BMI. Data from adolescents with overweight/obesity attending our outpatient weight management program (N=124) indicate that 82% of these youth report emotion regulation scores that are comparable to youth with significant mental health problems. Despite documented relationships between adolescent weight control and emotion regulation, no proven adolescent weight management programs targeting emotion regulation exist. To fill this gap, our laboratory developed and piloted an adolescent weight control intervention (HealthTRAC) that combines two previously tested effective interventions, one targeting emotion regulation skill building, the other focused on behavioral weight control. Findings from our small pilot trial are promising and indicate that the newly created HealthTRAC intervention is acceptable to parents and teens, easy to deliver, and leads to modest weight loss and improved emotion management skills compared to a standard behavioral weight control (SBWC) program. These data suggest that emotion regulation is related to weight management and may assist adolescents with overweight/obesity who are seeking to lose weight. The current multi-site study builds on this previous work and will examine the impact of the developed HealthTRAC intervention on improving emotion regulation skills and reducing adolescent BMI in a larger sample with longer term follow-up (18 months after starting the intervention). Adolescents will receive 27.5 hours of intervention time over a 12- month period. We expect that adolescents enrolled in the HealthTRAC intervention will show greater reduction in BMI over the 12-month program and will sustain these losses up to 18 months after starting the intervention compared to teens enrolled in SBWC. The information learned from this project will help us better understand how helping adolescents manage their emotions can improve weight loss outcomes."

To date, light aerobic exercises, such as early mobilisation and low-intensity ambulation, have become part of standard of care during severe AECOPD. Nevertheless, additional strength training using neuromuscular electrical stimulation and functional exercises, which have been shown to prevent skeletal muscle dysfunction whilst inducing minimal stress in the ventilatory system, might be of added value to optimize patients' functional performance and symptoms during activities at discharge.

The postoperative morbidity, the ability to rehabilitate or the mid-term survival are not addressed by these means. Recently there have been some reports that addition of physical performance testing to the standard prediction models may provide prognostic value. There is a wide scale of various physical performance and frailty tests that could be used for this purpose, but they have not been confronted with each other yet. Moreover, the postoperative physical rehabilitation has not been objectively assessed in larger scale despite the significant improvement in technology. The hypothesisis of the study is that the preoperative outcomes of physical performance and frailty testing are able to predict the patient's reconvalescence after cardiac surgery in the short- and mid-term postoperatively. The aim is to analyze a set of tests with regard to their ability to predict postoperative reconvalescence, including the objective activity assessment (using Actigraph wGT3X-BT activity tracking device). Secondarily, the investigators aim to follow the patients up to 1 year postoperatively in terms of evaluating their mid-term outcomes."

Unfortunately, rural people with heart disease and depressive symptoms do not receive needed therapy for depressive symptoms because of lack of mental health providers in rural areas, worries about stigma, and difficulty accessing mental health care because of multiple barriers to traveling to get care. To overcome these barriers, the investigators will compare the impact of two types of online cognitive behavioral therapy (video-conferenced face-to-face versus self-administered internet-based) and usual care on depressive symptoms to provide patients and healthcare providers with needed information about which is more effective and to increase the number of patients adequately treated."

However, increasing hospital mobility remains challenging because of the multiple existing barriers. The goal of this clinical trial is to test the effect of a multilevel intervention to increase hospital mobility, which addresses modifiable barriers and facilitators and does not require unavailable additional resources. This study aims to answer whether this intervention can improve mobility and patient-relevant outcomes such as life-space mobility and functional status. The multilevel intervention will target: 1. The patients, who will receive an information booklet, a customizable diary, an exercise booklet and an iPad with access to the videos of the exercise booklet. 2. The healthcare professionals (nursing staff and physicians) who will complete an e-learning, receive an oral presentation on the intervention, and receive a \"mobility checklist\" that reminds them of what they should assess daily regarding mobility. 3. The hospital environment, where posters will be hung in the wards, including walking itineraries, on topics of interest to older adults. In a first phase, the intervention will be pilot-tested in one ward of each hospital. The intervention will then be adapted based on patient and healthcare professional feedback. In a second phase, the intervention will be tested in a cluster randomized controlled trial, and compared to standard of care."

            "Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are the number one cause of death in America and most of the post-industrial world. Hypertension is a leading risk factor for CVDs including stroke, myocardial infarction, and heart failure. Black Americans suffer from the highest rates of hypertension of any racial/ethnic group in America, among the highest in the world. There are also well-documented racial disparities in vascular dysfunction (e.g., endothelial dysfunction, arterial stiffening). Thus, racial disparities in hypertension and vascular dysfunction exacerbate the burden of CVDs, with Black Americans being 30% more likely to die from CVD than any other race in the US. It is established that mitochondrial dysfunction contributes to vascular dysfunction. However, there is a knowledge gap regarding whether targeting mitochondrial dysfunction attenuates oxidative stress, vascular dysfunction, and CVD risk among Black adults at heightened CVD risk. Thus, the investigators will conduct an 8-week trial with the mitochondrial antioxidant MitoQ in middle-aged and older Black and non-Black adults. Our overarching hypothesis is that mitochondrial dysfunction contributes to heightened oxidative stress, vascular dysfunction, and higher BP in Black adults; and that MitoQ will attenuate these racial differences. Importantly, the investigators will also assess social determinants of health (e.g., income, neighborhood disadvantage, discrimination) and health behaviors (e.g., diet, physical activity) and uncover their role in oxidative stress, vascular function, and BP Regarding methodology, the investigators will perform blood draws, vascular testing, preceding and following an 8-week, 20mg daily consumption of MitoQ and placebo.

            "This project seeks to better understand dietary lapses (instances of nonadherence to dietary goals), a major cause of poor outcomes during behavioral obesity treatment (BOT). Investigators propose to conduct multimodal real-time assessment of behavioral, psychosocial, and contextual characteristics to uncover lapse phenotypes (i.e., meaningful clusters of lapse behaviors, such as lapsing via overeating vs. lapsing via eating an off-plan food). Using wearable sensors and a smartphone-based assessment platform, this research will identify latent characteristics underlying different phenotypes of dietary lapses reported by individuals who are participating in an online BOT. This study will also evaluate how these emerging lapse phenotypes vary over time, between individuals, and within individuals. Such information will ultimately help the field understand how best to reduce lapses in future treatments (e.g., how much to personalize future interventions for lapse vs. generalizability of lapse phenotypes across individuals). Therefore, this study has three goals. First, investigators aim to establish lapse phenotypes by identifying clusters of behavioral, psychosocial, contextual and individual-level factors (e.g., sex, race) that differentiate lapse behaviors during weight loss and maintenance. Second, the investigators aim to test the association of lapse phenotypes with energy intake and weight change during weight loss and maintenance to determine which lapse phenotypes have the greatest impact on BOT outcomes (e.g. personal, environmental, and behavioral factors). Lastly, investigators aim to evaluate individual variability in the occurrence of lapse phenotypes during weight loss and maintenance to determine the generalizability of lapse phenotypes across individuals. Participants will be recruited through various methods including advertisements in local media, targeted online advertising, advertisements in medical and minority communities, and direct mailers. All participants will receive a well-established online BOT program for 12 months, with a 6-month maintenance period, for a total study participation of 18 months. In conjunction, they will complete 14-day monitoring periods (at baseline, 3 months, 6 months, 12 months, and 18 months) consisting of: 1) repeated daily smartphone surveys to assess personal, environmental, and behavioral factors, including automatic capture of geographic location; 2) wearing two wrist-based sensor devices to passively capture physical activity, sleep, and eating behaviors; and 3) completing telephone-based 24-hour dietary recalls to assess overall energy intake.

It is well known that increased muscle mass is associated with increased resting energy expenditure which may facilitate weight loss and maintenance. Previous studies have, however, failed to show any consistent association between the intensity of physical exercise and energy expenditure, or relate the variance in these adaptations to genetic variability. Whether high-intensity exercise (HIE) is associated with improved health related quality of life in severely obese patients remains unknown. This PhD-project is based on a planned randomised controlled study including 50 or more treatment seeking morbidly obese patients who will be randomised to either a 24 week moderate-intensity exercise (MIE) programme or a 24 week high-intensity exercise (HIE) programme. The investigators main hypothesis is that patients randomised to the HIE-program will achieve higher energy expenditure during rest and physical activity after treatment than those allocated to the MIE-programme. In addition, the investigators hypothesise that the HIE-group will achieve a better health related quality of life than the MIE-group after treatment. The investigators also hypothesize that inter-individual variability in adaptation to the two training regimens may be due to genetic factors. If the investigators hypotheses are confirmed, this project might have beneficial clinical implications for future obesity treatment strategies."

Low levels of physical activity and high levels of sedentary behavior may contribute to the development of excessive fatness in young children, but these relationships have not been fully explored, and accelerometry rarely has been used to measure physical activity levels in infants and toddlers. No previous study has used accelerometry as an objective measure of physical activity in young children as they develop from infancy to preschool age. Accordingly, little is known about the factors associated with the development of physical activity behavior in very young children, and little is known about the influence of physical activity and sedentary behavior, measured objectively, on development of weight status during the transition from infancy to age 3. The first aim of this study is to describe physical activity and sedentary behavior in young children as they develop from infancy to preschool age.

The literature estimates that 10-50% of patients undergoing spinal surgery are likely to develop such pain, representing a substantial financial burden. Among them, 5-10% would suffer from severe pain, which are intense, neuropathic and generally refractory to conventional therapeutic strategies considerably affect patients' functional capacity as well as their psychological and social well-being. Spinal Cord Stimulation (SCS) is a well-established therapy to alleviate severe intractable neuropathic pain such as FBSS. SCS is a safe and reversible treatment option, which leads to improvement in pain relief and quality of life for patients with FBSS. Despite encouraging results in a chronic painful patient population that is refractory to conventional therapies, the literature estimates that only 58% [53% - 64%] of patients implanted with SCS devices achieved adequate pain relief. FBSS population characterization and stratification and predictive modeling of SCS outcome are thus crucial to delineate future treatment options and to deliver neuromodulation therapy to the right patient. The investigators designed a clinical prospective project based on SCS outcome optimization and SCS candidates' stratification: PREDIBACK 2. This study would be a following part of a continuous project (PREDIBACK) that aims to better understand and stratify the therapies (drugs, surgery, psychological therapy or SCS) proposed to FBSS patients. The goal of PREDIBACK 1 was to develop a decision tool that simplifies the therapeutic decision process. PREDIBACK 2 will focus on the neuromodulation pathway. Easing and helping patient orientation should improve referral yielding to specialists and accelerate patient flow through care pathway. Hence, facilitating access to adequate therapies for FBSS patients who usually have a longstanding history of pain."

Likewise, severe/morbid obesity increases the risk of illness, reduces quality of life, and raises health-care costs. Bariatric surgery is the election method for the treatment of severe/morbid obesity, resulting in significant weight loss and remission of comorbidities. However, a relatively large proportion of bariatric patients regain weight and continue to be at high risk for cardiovascular disease and premature mortality. A healthy lifestyle following bariatric surgery is essential for optimizing and maintaining weight loss. Observational studies suggest that physical activity following bariatric surgery might be associated with additional weight loss and more effective weigh loss maintenance over time. However, very little experimental evidence exists regarding the effects of supervised exercise on obesity-related outcomes in this specific population. The aim of the EFIBAR (Ejercicio F\u00cdsico tras cirug\u00eda BARi\u00e1trica) randomized controlled trial is to determine the effects of a 16-week supervised concurrent (aerobic and strength) exercise intervention program, on weight loss (primary outcome), body composition, cardiometabolic risk, physical fitness and quality of life (secondary outcomes) in patients with severe/morbid obesity following bariatric surgery. According to the study aims the investigators pursue the following hypothesis: Supervised exercise will result in larger weight loss than control."

            "Proposing ways to effectively counter chronic low back pain through non-drug intervention is a major public health issue due to the prevalence and health costs of this condition. The back school (BS) is based on spinal economics and a biomechanical model. A convergence of evidence indicates that this type of program does not bring any mid- or long-term benefit. Faced with this observation, a Pain Neuroscience Education (PNE) has been developed based on a biopsychosocial model. Chronic low back pain is the consequence of a complex dynamic of multifactorial origin where the body lesion is no longer the only cause of the pain. Studies have shown that PNE has a positive effect on pain perception. One of the limitations of these studies is that they do not allow objective measurement of physical activity performed at a distance from a therapeutic program for patients who have benefited from these educational programs. Yet, physical activity is an essential variable in health and more specifically in the fight against pain in patients with chronic low back pain. The investigators believe that physical activity is a key factor in improving the condition of patients with chronic low back pain. Consequently, physical activity is an indicator of success but also a guarantee for a lasting effect of educational treatment. In order to measure this physical activity, the use of activity monitor (connected watch) developed in recent years now makes it possible to collect data in an ecological manner that is more objective than the data collected via self-questionnaires. The main objective of the study is to measure the effectiveness of a PNE on physical activity three months after the intervention compared to BS in patients with chronic low back pain receiving a multidisciplinary rehabilitation program. The secondary aims are to compare effectiveness of PNE versus BS on pain, quality of life, kinesiophobia, pain catastrophizing, central sensitization at 3 months and at one year after the intervention. In addition, an exploratory analysis will be conducted to determine predictors of physical activity maintenance. The investigators expect to observe greater physical activity in patients who have received a PNE program compared to the physical activity of patients who have completed an BS program."

            "Type 1 diabetes (T1D) affects approximately 2 million Americans, and only 2 in 8 young adults ages 18-30 years achieve glycemic targets (glycated hemoglobin A1C <7.0%). Achieving glycemic targets is associated with reduced risk of micro-and macrovascular complications. Sleep deprivation leads to impaired glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity in adults without chronic conditions and with T1D. Promoting sleep in laboratory and natural environments contributes to improvements in insulin sensitivity, glucose levels, and distress symptoms in young adults without chronic conditions and more time in range in adolescents with T1D. Multiple dimensions of sleep health (alertness, timing, efficiency, and sleep duration) are associated with better achievement of glycemic targets in adults with T1D. Therefore, sleep health dimensions are appropriate therapeutic targets to improve glucoregulation and other diabetes self-management outcomes in this population. Our primary objective is to evaluate the immediate and short-term effects of a 12-week CB-sleep intervention compared to enhanced usual care (time balanced attention control) on actigraphy- and self-report derived sleep health dimensions and diabetes self-management outcomes (glycemia and distress symptoms) over 9-months (Stage II of the NIH Model for Behavior Change, ORBIT phase III). CB-sleep is guided by principles and practices from motivational interviewing and the Transtheoretical Model of Behavior Change with interactive stage-matched sessions."

Both exercise programs (BT and MT) will last 24 weeks, twice a week, 45 minutes per session. In some assessments, the participants of exercise groups will be evaluated at 3 time points (baseline, after 12 and 24 weeks). Participants from the Control Group will participate in the assessments (initial [baseline] and final [24 weeks]). Our hypotheses are: 1. In comparison with the control group, both exercise regimes groups (BT and MT) will positively impact on cognitive health status, physical-functional fitness, and risk of falls in community-dwelling elders. 2. The observed effects on cognitive health status, physical-functional fitness, and risk of falls as a result of the BT program will be superior to the effects arisen from the MT exercise regime."

PARTICIPANTS: The effects of the interventions are evaluated among dyads of two adults (partner-partner dyads). Adults forming dyads (e.g. two romantic partners, two relatives, two co-workers, two friends) who are in regular contact for at least one year will be enrolled. A minimum of 50 dyads enrolled into the each arm of the trial (a total of 200 dyads). The interventions consist of six planning sessions. DESIGN: The dyads are randomly assigned to one of four experimental conditions. The assessment of the main and secondary outcomes is conducted at the baseline, at 1 week after the first intervention session, at post-intervention (after six intervention sessions are completed), and at 6-, and 12-month follow-ups. OUTCOMES: Physical activity constitutes the main outcome, whereas health-related quality of life (HRQOL), body mass index, and sedentary behavior as well as the self-regulatory strategy called the use of planning (individual, dyadic and collaborative) are secondary outcomes."

Latina girls are less likely to meet guidelines for moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) than non-Hispanic white girls; factors that contribute to low PA rates among Latina girls include sex role expectations, low PA competency, few active role models, lack of parental support for PA, and lack of access to resources. The goal of this study, informed by social cognitive theory and family systems theory, is to design, implement, and evaluate an intervention promoting physical activity among Latina pre-adolescent girls (aged 8-11) and their mothers. The intervention is based on evidence suggesting that parent-child interventions and single-sex interventions are more effective at improving PA. Mothers and daughters will participate in a 12-week virtual intervention where they will engage in weekly 1.5-hour sessions that incorporate didactic teaching, skill-building, interactive discussions, and PA. Each session will include at least 30 minutes of PA. The intervention will be compared with a control condition that will receive an abbreviated version of the intervention following completion of all measurement points. Ninety mother-daughter dyads will be randomly assigned to the intervention or the wait-list control condition. The primary aim is to determine whether the intervention will increase MVPA among Latina girls in the intervention condition relative to those in the control condition.

            "Sarcopenia is one of the major causes of functional decline and negative health outcomes among older adults. Prominent evidence suggests exercise interventions can reverse sarcopenia. However, past studies mainly focus on structured exercise programs, automatically excluding many older adults who are not motivated and lack the time/resources to conduct the structural exercise. Therefore, we propose to examine the effect of the Sarcopenia Translation functional Exercise Program (the STEP program) on community-dwelling older adults. The STEP is a functional exercise program designed to address low motivation and other time/resources barriers for rapid translation in community settings. The 12-week STEP program teaches older adults to apply functional exercise activities incorporating resistant training principles in their daily routines. With a dual focus apriori in assessing clinical effectiveness and potential implementation strategies for future community implementations, we will conduct a single-blind randomized control trial among 60 community-dwelling older adults at risk or with sarcopenia. The study's purposes are threefold: (1) to assess the effect of the functional exercise intervention compared to usual care on primary outcomes of sarcopenia (muscle strength, muscle mass, and physical function); (2) to assess the long-term effects of the functional exercise intervention on primary outcomes of sarcopenia; (3) explore potential implementation strategies for rapid community implementation including development of a communityappropriate protocol for tracking long-term effects such as metabolomic biomarkers. This study aims to develop an effective functional exercise program as an alternative to structured exercise programs. Additionally, the goal is to accelerate the translation of the functional exercise program for older adults at risk or with sarcopenia in real-world settings."

This study will build upon previous literature by examining the impact of a 10-week (2x a week; 60-minutes per session) virtual adapted aerobic dance intervention (adapted Zumba\u00ae) in adults with DD ages 20-69 (n=58). Participants will be quasi-randomized to one of three groups: control (normal activities), low-tempo Zumba\u00ae, and high-tempo Zumba\u00ae. The quasi-randomization enables the investigators to ensure similarities in relevant demographic factors (e.g., disability type, age, sex) across the three groups. This design will enable the investigators to determine the effects of Zumba\u00ae and the impact of tempo level on relevant outcome measures. Participants will compete testing three times - pre-test, post-test, and a 4-week follow-up test - to determine the immediate and long-term benefits of Zumba\u00ae. Changes in functional mobility (Timed Up-And-Go), balance (Clinical Test of Sensory Interaction on Balance), aerobic capacity (6-minute Walk Test), and executive functioning (Flanker) will be assessed. During the program, participants' moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) will be measured using accelerometry. Compared to the control group, the investigators hypothesize that both Zumba groups will show an improvement in body composition, balance, functional mobility, executive functioning, aerobic capacity, and MVPA during the program. Moreover, the investigators hypothesize that the high tempo group will improve body composition, balance, functional mobility, executive functioning, aerobic capacity, and MVPA during the program more than the low tempo."

Now, sedentary lifestyles are well recognized as one of the causes of mortality. As with physical activity, a dose-response relationship appears to exist: mortality would increase with time spent in sedentary behaviors. However, this relationship would not be linear: the more the daily sitting time increases, the more the consequences on mortality are important. It is now well demonstrated that time spent in sedentary adult behaviour finds primarily its origin in the work, characterized by prolonged and uninterrupted periods of sitting. Many strategies have been settled to break the prolonged sitting time. The most promising one seem to be the use of active workstations (standing, walking, cycling, stepping) because they reduce sedentary time at work and increase physical activity with positive effects on the global health. However inter variability in energy response have been identified during a sit to stand allocation with subject \"savers\" profile showing an increase in energy expenditure while others categorized as \"non-savers\" increased significantly their energy expenditure between sitting and standing position. As others active workstation strategies exist, this study aim to first, better characterize energy response to posture and activity allocation (15min sit-15min stand-15min sit-15min low intensity cycling), secondly to identify parameters that could explain different energy profile."

            "Individuals who are overweight/obese are more vulnerable to type 2 diabetes (T2D). Current evidence suggests that PA, even without dietary prescription, can be efficacious in preventing T2D. Yet most Americans, especially those who are overweight/obese, are not physically active. Socioenvironmental barriers to physical activity (PA) such as body image concerns and limited access to fitness facilities contribute to the low levels of PA observed in overweight/obese adults. Web-based PA programs have been developed to address these barriers, but the outcomes have been marginal. Qualitative studies suggest that individuals who are overweight/obese prefer PA programs that feature people they can relate to especially in body size, fitness status and age. Previously, the investigators have included these preferences in a technology-based Physical Activity for The Heart (PATH) intervention that leverages open source platforms, such as YouTube, to promote PA in any setting. In this application, the investigators propose to test the feasibility and preliminary efficacy of PATH in promoting PA and reducing cardiometabolic risk in adults who are overweight/obese and at high risk of diabetes. In Aim 1 the investigators will conduct a 12-week randomized clinical trial including 52 adults who are overweight/obese and at high risk of diabetes to assess the feasibility and acceptability of PATH. In Aim 2 investigators will examine the trend in PA and cardiometabolic risk change from baseline to post-intervention. This approach is innovative because it leverages open source technologies to provide low-cost, action-oriented PA resources that match the preferences of adults who are overweight/obese. This contribution will be significant because PATH could offer a convenient, enjoyable and scalable program that features \"similar others\" to promote PA in overweight/obese adults at high risk of diabetes."

Research has shown that psychological treatments can help people with chronic pain manage their pain and improve their quality of life. Three common psychological treatments for chronic pain are Cognitive Therapy (CT), Mindfulness Meditation (MM), and Activation Skills (AS). While research has shown these treatments are helpful for people with chronic pain, there is little research explaining why these treatments are helpful. The purpose of this study is to understand the specific ways these treatments work. Increasing our understanding of how these treatments work will help researchers and clinicians improve treatments for people with chronic pain in the future. Aim 1, Primary: Researchers will determine how much late-treatment improvement in pain interference related to the study's psychological treatments is predicted by early-treatment changes in the content of negative thoughts about pain (i.e., pain catastrophizing), thought processes (i.e., non-judgment), and/or activity level. Hypothesis 1a: Early treatment changes in pain catastrophizing, non-judgment, and activity level are significantly related with late treatment improvements in pain interference. Hypothesis 1b: If changes in pain catastrophizing, non-judgment, and activity level are mechanisms shared across the three treatments, then the actual treatment condition will have small and non-significant effects on early changes in the mechanism variables. This is known as the Shared Mechanisms Model. Hypothesis 1c: If changes in pain catastrophizing, non-judgment, and activity level are mechanisms specific to CT, MM, and AS, respectively, then treatment condition will have a significant effect on early changes in the mechanism variables (i.e., the effects of the three treatments on the three mechanism variables will be different, with CT having the largest effects on early treatment decreases in catastrophizing, MM having the largest effects on early treatment increases in non-judgment, and AS having the largest effects on early treatment increases in activity level). In addition, later improvement in the primary outcome will be predicted by different mechanism variables as a function of treatment condition; that is, late treatment changes in pain interference will be substantially and uniquely predicted by early treatment changes in: (1) cognitive content (i.e., pain catastrophizing) in CT but not in MM or AS; (2) cognitive process (i.e., non-judgment) in MM but not in CT or AS; and (3) activity level in AS but not in CT or MM, in addition to each mechanism variable significantly predicting the primary outcome. This is known as the Specific Mechanisms Model. Researchers also predict that change in the mechanism variables will precede and predict change in outcome, but not vice versa. Secondary Objective: As a secondary aim, this study will also examine the post-treatment mechanisms that explain relapse, maintenance, and continued gains associated with these treatments [Aim 2; Secondary]. The Shared (Hypothesis 2a) and Specific (Hypothesis 2b) Mechanism models will also be applied to data collected via EMA and ActiGraph daily during the 4-weeks post-treatment to better understand the post-treatment mechanisms that underlie maintenance of gains and relapse. Exploratory Objective: Researchers will test if (1) higher baseline levels of catastrophizing are associated with a positive response to the CT intervention, (2) lower baseline levels of activity are associated with a positive response to AS, and (3) higher baseline levels of non-judgment are associated with a positive response to MM."

            "Exercise training is a key component in the prevention and treatment of various chronic diseases such as Type 2 diabetes (T2DM). Adaptations and effects that occur with exercise training differ according to exercise protocols. Most exercise interventions in T2DM base their results on HbA1c. Since the molecular and epigenetic effects of exercise training on \u03b2-cell function have not been fully revealed, the importance and effect of exercise training have not been fully understood. The patients included in the study will be divided into six groups; the control group (20 adolescents), the moderate continuous aerobic exercise training group (20 adolescents), the high-intensity interval training group (20 adolescents), the resistance exercise training group (20 adolescents), combination of moderate continuous aerobic exercise training with resistance exercise training group (20) and combination of high-intensity interval training with resistance exercise training (20 adolescents). At the beginning of the study, demographic and physical characteristics of the patients will be recorded, and anthropometric and laboratory evaluations, pulmonary function test, measurement of respiratory muscle strength and endurance, measurement of peripheral muscle strength, evaluation of functional and aerobic capacity, measurement of physical activity levels and energy consumption, evaluation of the quality of life, epigenetic analysis, evaluation of \u03b2-cell function and biochemical structure of insulin will be done. All patients will receive exercise training 3 days a week for 16 weeks. All measurements and evaluations will be made before starting exercise training and after 16 weeks of exercise training. As a result of the data obtained, it will be tried to objectively present which type of exercise intervention, at which doses and frequencies, will be more effective for patients with T2DM, with its effect on epigenetic factors."

            "Sleep disturbances are considered a significant public health concern. The prevalence of disrupted sleep among US adults has increased to alarming levels. Around 70 million Americans suffer from a sleep disturbance. Reduced sleep and poor sleep quality have been linked to cardiovascular disease, increased risk for obesity, hypertension, heart attack, and stroke. Sleep disturbances are characterized by dissatisfaction with sleep quality or sleep quantity, which may be associated with difficulties initiating sleep, difficulties maintaining sleep, or early-morning awakenings with an inability to return to sleep. Sleep disturbances including insomnia can be treated with pharmacological treatments. However, individuals often report adverse side effects. Increasing attention has therefore been paid to behavioral and psychological interventions, such as cognitive behavioral therapy and mindfulness. The study will assess a smartphone-based sleep program by Headspace Health that combines cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBTi) and mindfulness concepts to minimize nocturnal symptoms and waking consequences associated with sleep disturbances. The study aims to test the effectiveness of the Headspace Health Sleep Program on self-reported outcomes related to sleep quality. A secondary aim is to test objective measures of sleep quality using actigraphy. The Headspace Health Sleep Program is an 18 day program based on CBTi, which includes the following intervention components: 1) a sleep diary to monitor sleep and associated factors; 2) cognitive interventions to address maladaptive thoughts related to sleep; 3) behavioral interventions to address maladaptive behaviors related to sleep (e.g., sleep hygiene, stimulus control, and sleep restriction); 4) de-arousal techniques (e.g., mindfulness, breathing, and muscle relaxation exercises)."

Twelve percent of older Latinos are currently diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease (AD), and it is estimated that the number of Latinos with AD will increase by 832% by 2060. Pharmacological treatments available for cognitive decline/ADRD have shown limited effectiveness in reducing cognitive and functional decline. Evidence suggests that protective factors for AD include regular physical activity (PA). Unfortunately, older Latinos are 46% less likely to engage in leisure time PA than older non-Latino whites. The investigators propose that indoor PA programs can overcome the biggest barriers to participation. Marquez and colleagues created a Spanish-language, Latin dance program (BAILAMOS\u2122 - Balance and Activity In Latinos, Addressing Mobility in Older Adults). Smaller studies of BAILAMOS\u2122 have found greater improvement in global cognition in the dance group compared to a health education group, and increases in brain functional connectivity. UIC faculty have also designed and tested Fit & Strong!, a PA program for older adults with arthritis, that is recognized by the National Council on Aging as an Evidence-based program and have established the feasibility of \u00a1En Forma y Fuerte!, an adaptation of Fit & Strong! for Latinos with arthritis. A small trial found significant improvements in lower-extremity strength, perceived physical function, and pain from baseline to 8 weeks (p < .05) that were maintained at 6 months. No major program adaptations (other than language) were observed or reported; however, the instructors provided several suggestions for program improvements, including adjusting the literacy level and length of the program. The current pandemic allows the investigators to adapt both of these evidence informed programs, the BAILAMOS\u2122 dance program and \u00a1En Forma y Fuerte!, for remote delivery among older Latinos (i.e., BAILAMOS\u2122 @home/en casa and \u00a1En Forma y Fuerte! @home/en casa).

            "Introduction Cognitive frailty is common in community-dwelling older people and is an at-risk state for adverse health outcomes such as dementia, dependency, and mortality. Fortunately, cognitive frailty is reversible, with a higher probability of reversibility at earlier stages. Physical activity is known to play a significant role in reversing cognitive frailty; its effect is moderated by intensity and sustainability. However, physical inactivity is very common in older people and is one of the key phenotypical characteristics of cognitive frailty. Moderate to vigorous physical activity (MVPA) can reduce the risk of worsening cognitive frailty. Brisk walking is a simple form of exercise that can be practised by community-dwelling older people every day to boost their physical activity to or above a moderate intensity level. Conventional behavioural change interventions (CBCIs) have been shown to effectively engage sedentary older people in physical activity, but their effect size is small. The use of e-health methods that adopt existing and popular e-platforms (e.g., Samsung Health and WhatsApp) to promote specific behaviours (e.g., regular brisk walking) in specific groups (e.g., older people with cognitive frailty) is an innovative, practically feasible and theoretically sound method of increasing MVPA. However, the relative effectiveness of e-health interventions and CBCIs in vulnerable groups (i.e., older people with cognitive frailty) is unknown. Objectives The objectives of this study are to compare the effectiveness of an e-health intervention and a conventional behavioural change intervention in older people with cognitive frailty in improving 1) moderate-to-vigorous physical activity, 2) reducing cognitive frailty, 3) improving cognitive function, 4) improving walking speed, 5) improving functional fitness, and 6) improving physical activity motivation Methods A single-blinded, two-parallel-group, non-inferiority, randomised controlled trial will be conducted in a community setting. Subjects will be recruited from five elderly community centres in Hong Kong. The eligibility criteria will be as follows: (1) aged \u2265 60, (2) cognitively frail, (3) physically inactive and (4) possessing a smartphone. The participants in the intervention group will receive an e-health intervention. Those in the control group will receive a CBCI. Each intervention will last for 14 weeks. The outcomes will be MVPA min/week (primary), as measured by a wrist-worn ActiGraph; cognitive frailty, as measured by an ordinal scale; cognitive function, as measured by the Montreal Cognitive Assessment; and frailty, as measured by the Fried frailty phenotype (FFP). The outcomes will be assessed at T0 (baseline), T1 (immediately post-intervention) and T2 (6 months post-intervention). The investigators plan to recruit 192 subjects. Permuted block randomisation with randomly selected block sizes in a ratio of 1:1 will be used. Only the outcome assessors will be blinded. Four generalised estimating equations will be used to test the effects of the interventions on the four outcomes, which will be the dependent variables. The independent variables will be group, time and [group] \u00d7 [time]. The level of significance will be set at 0.05. Significance If the e-health intervention proves to be more effective and sustainable than the CBCI, There will be evidence suggesting that e-health interventions can replace CBCIs in promoting MVPA and treating cognitive frailty in older people in community settings. Further studies could then examine the potential role of e-health interventions in delaying the onset of dementia and dependency."

Despite the well-documented T2D disparities in this minority group, limited work has been conducted to improve health outcomes in Chinese Americans. The goal of this Pathway to Independence Award (K99/R00) is to expedite the candidate's transition to an independent investigator who possesses focused expertise in development and evaluation of culturally and linguistically tailored and sustainable interventions to reduce T2D disparities in Chinese Americans. In the K99 phase of this award, the candidate will obtain critical training needed to accomplish this goal and will develop a short message service (SMS) intervention to improve T2D management in Chinese Americans. More specifically, the aims are to 1) characterize barriers and facilitators of glycemic control in Chinese Americans with T2D (Aim 1a); 2) develop culturally and linguistically tailored SMS intervention content (Aim 1b); and 3) assess the feasibility and acceptability of the SMS intervention in a pre-, post-test study (Aim 1c). In the R00 phase, the candidate will refine the SMS intervention based on the K99 pilot data and evaluate the proof-of-concept regarding its efficacy in a pilot randomized controlled trial among 66 Chinese Americans with T2D (Aim 2). Participants will be randomized to one of 2 arms (n=30 each): 1) wait-list control and 2) SMS intervention. Both groups will continue to receive standard of care treatment for their T2D. The SMS group will receive brief lifestyle counseling videos via SMS links. At the end of the study, the wait-list control group will be provided the opportunity to receive the SMS-based counseling videos. Measurements will be obtained at baseline, 3, and 6 months. The primary outcome is HbA1c and secondary outcomes include self-efficacy, diabetes self-management behaviors, dietary intake and physical activity behaviors. Linear mixed modeling will be used to examine the group and group by time interaction effects between the SMS intervention and wait-list control group. Findings from this R00 study will inform a larger full-scale R01 efficacy trial of the SMS intervention, and ultimately, establish the candidate's program of research focused on developing and testing sustainable interventions to reduce disparities in chronic disease outcomes in Chinese Americans. This project can serve as a program model for other chronic disease interventions in Chinese Americans that require lifestyle modification (e.g., prediabetes, hypertension), or for disparities research in other high-risk immigrant populations (e.g., South Asians, Hispanic Americans)."

In the first year, the cerebral hemodynamics measured by commercial fNIRS during resting state and cognitive tasks from 60 generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) patients and 30 healthy subjects will be processed and analyzed using AI algorithms. The novel anxiety fNIRS biomarker will be identified and correlated to clinical anxiety scales (such as HARS and STAI). In the second year, the reliability, validity, and responsiveness of the AI-fNIRS biomarker will be validated. The accuracy of using AI-fNIRS biomarker to predict the diagnosis of GAD (according to DSM-5) and anxiety rating scales will be calculated from 60 GAD patients and 30 healthy subjects. In the third year, a neurofeedback method using AI-fNIRS biomarkers to guide digital cognitive behavior therapy (dCBT) through visual/audio cues will be developed. A pilot study with 12 GAD patients will be performed to test the feasibility of mindfulness training during AI-fNIRS neurofeedback. In the fourth year, a large scale RCT will be performed to validate the therapeutic efficacy of AI-fNIRS neurofeedback dCBT in 40 patients with GAD. The protocol of using real-time AI-fNIRS biomarkers as a neurofeedback to augment mindfulness training will be optimized according to previous year."

            "The proposed studies will test this hypothesis by randomizing patients with AF to 2-HOBA or placebo 7 days prior to AF ablation to allow 2-HOBA to reach steady-state levels. We hypothesize that tissue injury from AF ablation causes a large release of ROS that react with lipids to generate IsoLGs (Figure 2). In the absence of 2-HOBA, IsoLGs will react within seconds to form IsoLG-macromolecule adducts in atrial tissue, promoting early recurrence of AF. In the presence of 2-HOBA, IsoLGs will rapidly react to form IsoLG-macromolecule adducts in atrial tissue, promoting early recurrence of AF. In the presence of 2-HOBA, IsoLG will preferentially bind to and therefore be inactivated by 2-HOBA thereby sparing injury to the atrial tissue caused by oxidative stress and its contribution to early recurrence of AF. Early recurrence of AF will be measured by ECGs that are recorded once per day by a smartwatch (Apple Watch, Apple Inc., Cupertino, CA) with additional ECGs recorded by the participant if they experience symptoms of AF, or if the smartwatch alerts the participant of a possible AF episode via its auto-detection AF monitoring algorithm. The Apple Watch's AF algorithm is based on sampling of heart rate and variability and will give an audible alarm if those parameters indicate a possible episode of AF. The smartwatch records a single-lead ECG if the participant touches the watch with their contralateral hand. The day and time of the episode is also stored by the smartwatch. At the end of the 28-day follow-up period, study personnel will review the stored ECGs. Blood will be drawn prior to ablation and on post-procedure Day 1 for measurement of IsoLG-adduct levels. DNA will be extracted to explore a pharmacogenomic interaction with haplotypes at the chromosome 4q25 AF risk locus, which: 1) is strongly associated with the development of AF and the early recurrence of AF after ablation27; and 2) has been reported to be a regulator of an anti-oxidant gene program in response to cardiac injury."

            "Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a heart rhythm disorder associated with debillitating symptoms, psychological distress and heart failure. It can also significantly increase an individuals stroke risk. Catheter ablation (CA) for AF is the most effective way to restore normal heart rhythm. However, AF can recur in up to 50% of patients after their first CA procedure and a second 'top-up' procedure may be needed to maximise effect. Early detection of recurrences can enable planning and treatment and repeat CA procedures. Post-CA follow-up strategies rely on episodic rhythm monitoring (Holter monitor tests) that usually last between 1 and 7 days. However, AF recurrences can be intermittent and may not occur during these short monitoring episodes. A greater duration of monitoring has been shown to yield greater detection of AF recurrences. Relying on symptoms alone to detect recurrence is also sub-optimal. AF recurrences can also be insidious. Similar symptoms may be reported from ectopy, atrial tachycardias or atrial flutter. These may require different management approaches, necessitating rhythm characterisation before considering a repeat CA. The Apple Watch (AW) is a wristwatch that is able to monitor a wearer's heart rate and rhythm regularity as well as facilitating an immediate, real-time single-lead ECG recording. This non-invasive device that can be purchased over- the-counter has demonstrated feasibility in detecting AF and may offer a potential non-invasive, alternative long-term rhythm surveillance strategy to diagnose AF in these patients. The investigators propose a single-centre, randomised controlled study to compare the standard follow-up strategy after index AF CA versus one supplemented with an AW-led prolonged monitoring strategy to determine if the latter will improve the expediency and rate of AF recurrence detection. Whether this will lead to improved downstream decision-making, reduction in symptomatic events and a lower prevalence of AF in the longer term will also be studied."

Patients with HF have reduced function capacity and quality of life (QoL) and hence it is imperative to explore interventions that impact endpoints that directly measure how a patient feels or functions on a daily basis. Recently, new mobile health technologies have emerged as clinical tools and offer an opportunity to overcome these challenges in measuring functional capacity and recording symptoms. These technologies are able to capture and integrate data from disparate sources from individual patients reflecting their functional status and symptomatology. These data can potentially serve as surrogate endpoints for approval of new HF therapies. In this study, the investigators will test the feasibility of a novel mobile health monitoring platform to capture patients' physiology, functional capacity and assessment of quality of life."

            "Repetitive blast exposure has been shown to lead to more severe neurobehavioral impairments versus a single exposure. Blast-induced Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) can lead to short- and long-term adverse outcomes Even mild brain injuries can impair neurocognitive performance, and repeated injuries can amplify negative outcomes. Service members with repeated exposure to low-level blasts as a necessary part of their job or training display altered neural activity during a memory task that is paralleled by a reduction in accuracy on neurocognitive memory tasks. As a result, it is important to monitor service members that are exposed to multiple blast-generated mTBIs to allow the earliest identification of acute or chronic brain and body insult and provide individualized measures of time to recovery. While TBI is clinically diagnosable, the methods of diagnosis have up to now been typically expensive and immobile, and treatments and interventions sparse. The investigators will conduct a longitudinal assessment of mTBI brain biomarkers by collecting repeated measures of FDA approved mTBI brain injury biomarkers, correlated with sound and blast exposure, as well as continuous monitoring through smart watches (activity, sleep, biometrics, calorie expenditure, balance) and analyte data through analyte sensors (glucose, lactate, ketones). Study data will be organized into categories and presented to participants daily within the application and will be securely stored within the application. At the completion of the study, participants will be provided with the study data digitally within the mobile application and study data will also be provided to the credentialed unit medical provider to enable it to be ported to the participants' electronic medical record. This study will create a continuous record of blast overpressure and sound exposures and correlate those to the participants health state over the course of several 9-week courses. This will enable an assessment of individualized susceptibility to brain injury as well as providing novel data on time to recovery.

            "No cause for stroke is found in up to 30% of cases despite extensive investigations. These are called cryptogenic strokes (CS). 1 in 4 stroke survivors will suffer another in 5 years and this is a leading cause of fear and anxiety. A common reason for CS is an undetected heart rhythm disorder called atrial fibrillation (AF). AF occurs intermittently, so it may not be detected during the mandated 24-96 hours of rhythm monitoring that is performed as part of the standard post-stroke investigation strategy. A randomised controlled study in 2014 showed that whereas this standard monitoring strategy picks up AF in 2% of CS patients, longer-term, continuous monitoring for 12 months can pick up AF in 13% of patients. This suggests the standard strategy may miss AF in a proportion of CS patients and thus also the opportunity to mitigate against further strokes with anticoagulation therapy. Prolonged monitoring has traditionally required a minimally-invasive surgical procedure to implant a recording device under the skin at a specialist centre. A specifically trained team is also required to interpret the large number of recordings this strategy yields. The Apple Watch (AW) is a wristwatch able to monitor a wearer's heart rate and rhythm regularity and facilitates real- time, single-lead ECG recordings. This over-the-counter, non-invasive device has demonstrated feasibility and has a Certification (CE) Mark for detecting AF. It may offer a potential non-invasive alternative long-term rhythm surveillance strategy to diagnose AF in these patients. The investigators propose a study in which CS patients will be randomised in a 1:1 ratio to receive additional AW monitoring on top of standard care versus standard care alone. The investigators shall then explore the incidence of AF in the two groups at 1 year and how it impacts clinical outcomes too."

            "Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common arrhythmia (irregular heart rhythm), affecting 1-2 million people in the UK. AF significantly increases the risk of an AF-related stroke, heart failure and dementia. A significant proportion of people will have no symptoms, and they may only be found to have AF after suffering an AF-related stroke. An electrocardiogram (ECG) uses sensors placed on the skin to record the heart's electrical activity. A 12-lead ECG uses 10 sensors and is the gold-standard (best available test) to detect any abnormal heart rhythm disturbances. Until recently, a 12-lead ECG showing an irregular heart rhythm was required to make a diagnosis of AF but as AF episodes are often short and unpredictable it may be missed. Therefore, a small device that continuously records heartbeat and heart rhythm could make the diagnosis of arrhythmias and AF much quicker and easier. Accessories such as watches or rings - referred to as wearable devices - have extremely good sensors that measure pulse rate by detecting small changes in skin colour during each heartbeat and can perform a single-lead ECG. Algorithms built in the wearable devices can identify irregular heart rhythms, such as atrial fibrillation. The purpose of this study is to test two new wearable devices - the Skylabs CART-I ring and the Apple Watch - in detecting abnormal heart rhythm recording and recording ECGs. The investigators plan to recruit 500 patients attending Cardiology Departments in several hospitals in the UK and will ask them to wear the Apple Watch and the CART-I and perform 12-lead ECG with each device (two in total). No extra follow-up visits are required. At the end of the study, the investigators will compare interpretation by two cardiologists of the wearable devices' ECGs and the 12-lead ECGs and look at their ability to automatically detect abnormal rhythms."

            "Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common arrhythmia affecting 1.3 million people in the UK. AF causes an irregular and fast heartbeat, which makes the heart pump poorly. As a result, blood clots may form inside the heart and, if they travel to the brain, can lead to an AF-related stroke. Patients with AF have a risk of stroke five-times higher than patients with normal rhythm. Anticoagulants make the blood less likely to clot and, thus, reduce the chances of an AF-related stroke. For most people, once anticoagulation is started it must be taken for the rest of their lives irrespective of the amount of AF someone has. However, anticoagulants make patients more prone to bleeding. New studies have reported a lower stroke risk in patients with short and infrequent AF episodes. If there are long time gaps in between AF episodes, short periods of anticoagulation around the time of AF may be enough to avoid clots from forming and reducing the overall risk of bleeding. To use anticoagulants only when needed will require an accurate and reliable way to detect AF when it occurs and alert patients. New technologies, such as small heart monitors placed under the skin, watches and rings, can track the heart rhythm continuously and send real-time alerts to patients via mobile phone message if AF is detected. The purpose of this study is to investigate if implantable cardiac monitors (LINQ II) and wearable devices (Apple Watch and CART-I ring) can detect AF episodes, send real-time alerts to patients and who will respond to these alerts within a short timeframe. The investigators will recruit 50 patients and follow them for six months. All participants will receive a LINQ II and a wearable device."

The target exercise training intensity during cardiac rehabilitation is between 40% to 70% of heart rate reserve (HRR). Also, cardiac patients who have hypoxemia are advised to continuously monitor their Spo2. Therefore, this study aims to investigate the accuracy of the Apple Watch in measuring the HR and Spo2 in Saudi patients with cardiac diseases. Method: A cross sectional study will be invited one-hundred cardiac patients will be invited and recruited to participate in this study and the eligible participants will be randomly allocated into two groups. The first group (Group-A) will include the cardiac patients with regular HR and the second group (Group-B) will include the cardiac patients with irregular HR. Both groups will use the apple watch to evaluate the HR and the Spo2 against the Polar HR monitor and pulse oximeter at rest, during, and after the mild to moderate intensity exercise training session (40% to 70% HRR). The HR and the Spo2 monitoring, and recording will run on a 30 second schedule at rest (pre-session; for 3-minutes), during the 15-minutes session and over 5-minutes after the session). The main outcomes will be the HR and the Spo2 and will be evaluated before, during and after the exercise session using the Apple watch and the Polar HR monitor. All participants will receive the mild to moderate exercise training session (40 to 70 % HRR) using cycling and treadmill instruments for 15 minutes, proceeded, and followed by a 3-minutes warm-up and cool-down."

            "When choosing outcomes to assess rehabilitation's effect or progress, it is essential to consider the constructs being measured and their value to the patient and the psychometric properties. Choosing an outcome that reflects all aspects of International Classification levels of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF) is challenging, especially in heterogeneous groups. However, it is important to know the psychometric properties as this gives important knowledge on how to interpret results and, consequently, how this can inform the patient's care. The Short Musculoskeletal Function Assessment (SMFA) questionnaire can reflect differences in patients' functional status with a broad range of disorders, like for elderly citizens undergoing municipality-based rehabilitation. Nevertheless, since there is no golden standard to measure rehabilitation outcomes, construct validity needs to be established to investigate how scores of SMFA can be related to measures on all levels of ICF. Therefore, this study has three main objectives: 1. To investigate how scores of the SMFA questionnaire are related to measures on different ICF levels 2. To describe the characteristics of older citizens starting municipality-based rehabilitation on all ICF levels 3. To investigate predictor variables of upper- and lower extremity strength"

            "Medications with sedative or anticholinergic effects such as antidepressants, benzodiazepines, or opioids have been associated with impaired cognitive and physical function. They are referred to as potentially inappropriate medications or medications that are best avoided by older adults. The accumulated evidence has now shifted the clinical and research focus to evaluating the who, what, and how of the best way to deprescribe (i.e., dose reduction or cessation of these medications). The Drug Burden Index (DBI) allows researchers and clinicians to quantify the cumulative burden of anticholinergic and sedative medications in each patient. Deprescribing these medications is a complex health intervention based on trade-offs between their clinical benefits (e.g., symptom management and prevention of diseases) and their adverse drug events to improve physical and cognitive function. Existing physical function performance metrics, such as gait speed captured in the clinic, are often non-specific and do not reflect real-life performance. Innovative mobility metrics are required to better understand specific deficits with age and disease and the effects of medications on these deficits. The goal of this project is to better characterize the impact of reducing the anticholinergic and sedative medication burden on physical function in older adults by novel mobility metrics in lab and real-life environments. A prospective, longitudinal cohort of 182 community-dwelling older adults (\u2265 65 years) with a DBI of \u2265 1 will be completed. Using a quasi-experimental design, recruited patients will undergo a medication deprescribing plan, as part of usual clinical care, that includes three gradual changes to their medication regimen resulting in three DBI levels. At each DBI level, physical function mobility including dual-task tests) will be assessed in the lab with wearable sensors during validated clinical tests such as the Short Physical Performance Battery. Objective balance and mobility metrics (e.g., sway area and frequency, stride length) will be extracted. Physical function will also be assessed continuously in the patient's real-life environment from recruitment to the last lab visit, using wearable (Apple Watch\u00ae with ankle inertial measurement unit) and environmental sensors. Cognition will be measured using the Montreal Cognitive Assessment, Trail Making Test Part A & B, and Digit Symbol Substitution Test."

To date, all PTSD assessments are retrospective; individuals with PTSD are asked to recount and report their symptoms over the past weeks or months. Such assessment procedures are negatively impacted by individuals' abilities to accurately recall information. Moreover, retrospective assessments provide little information about how symptoms are experienced in the moment and how these experiences then lead to other behaviors. The proposed project addresses these limitations by assessing PTSD symptoms and associated biological markers (e.g., sleep, heart rate, heart rate variability) in real-time by asking subjects to wear a smart device and complete brief surveys. Data will be collected from 50 individuals with PTSD and 20 healthy controls to help us better understand individuals' real-time experience with PTSD and lay the foundation to develop algorithms for possible in-the-moment interventions in the future."

            "Once a pregnant mother is diagnosed with gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM), she will be treated with either diet, medication (i.e., insulin), or both. The most important factor in GDM management is glycemic control to reduce adverse outcomes. Blood glucose levels have become the \"key player\" for monitoring and directing treatment during pregnancy. Large trials have confirmed that treatment of GDM to optimize glycemic control can decrease the incidence of many of these associated adverse maternal and neonatal outcomes. Up to now, SMBG (self-monitoring of blood glucose) is recommended for women with gestational diabetes that involves finger pricking up to six times daily. However, SMBG provides an incomplete picture of the daily glucose profile due to long intervals between finger pricking, and inaccurate self-reported measurements, which heavily rely on patients' compliance."

            "Hypoglycemia (low blood glucose) is a very common problem in newborns, and has been associated with poor neurodevelopment, cognition, and school performance. At-risk newborns (infants of diabetic mothers [IDM], large [LGA] and small [SGA] for gestational age infants, and late preterm [LPT] infants) undergo a hypoglycemia screening protocol that involves numerous intermittent needle sticks to test glucose levels on bedside glucometers; however, continuous glucose monitoring (CGM, currently not approved for clinical use in babies), via a small sensor placed in the thigh (only 1 needle stick), would likely decrease pain while providing continuous glucose levels. This study will evaluate the feasibility, safety, and precision of CGM in at-risk newborns, and determine if this method would decrease the amount of painful procedures and episodes of hypoglycemia missed by intermittent sampling. As part of regular medical care, participants will undergo intermittent blood glucose screening with heel sticks as per the current hospital standard of care protocol. Regular medical care involves checking the participant's blood glucose via heel stick every few hours using a bedside glucometer, with another heel stick to confirm low values in the laboratory. If the participant has low values, he/she may be treated with oral glucose gel, feedings of breast milk or formula, or intravenous (IV) fluids in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU). This research study involves placing a CGM device in addition to undergoing the current blood glucose screening protocol and treatment. As soon as possible after birth, a continuous glucose monitoring device (Dexcom G7) will be placed on the participant's thigh by a research team member, and will blindly continuously record glucose levels that will be analyzed after discharge. Everyone who agrees to participate in this study will have placement of this experimental device. The investigational device will stay in place for the same amount of time that a participant is undergoing blood glucose monitoring as per the current standard of care protocol, for a maximum of 7 days. A participant may need to have his/her blood glucose checked after 7 days for regular medical care (and not for research), because his/her glucose concentrations are still low. Being in the research study will not affect a participant's medical care, and will not affect how long he/she needs blood glucose monitoring or treatment. A research team member will place and remove the CGM. Nurses will evaluate the site of the device for signs of irritation, infection, bleeding, and any other issues at least 3 times per day. After discharge from the hospital, data will be collected from the participant's medical record and participant's mother's medical record, including the participant's sex and birth weight, blood glucose values, details of feedings, treatments given for low glucose concentrations, and NICU admission data. Data that will be collected from the participant's mother's medical record includes age and race, prenatal data, medical history, and medication use. The participant's parents will be asked to fill out a short survey about their experience with this device when it is removed."

This is an open-label, multicentre, single-period, randomised, parallel group design study. It is expected that a total of up to 190 subjects (aiming for 96 randomised subjects) will be recruited within ten working days of diagnosis of type 1 diabetes through paediatric diabetes centres in the UK. Half of the participants aged 10 to 16.9 years will be treated by conventional insulin injections and the other half by the artificial pancreas (closed loop insulin delivery system). Each treatment will last 24 months. All participants completing the 24 month study period will be invited to continue in an optional extension phase with the treatment allocated at randomisation for a further 24 months. Subjects in the intervention group will receive additional training on components of the artificial pancreas, i.e. insulin pump and continuous glucose monitoring (CGM), prior to starting closed loop insulin delivery. Subjects in the control intervention group will continue with standard therapy, i.e. multiple daily injection therapy. The study includes up to 14 visits and 1 telephone/email contact for subjects completing the study. After run-in and randomisation, visits will be conducted every 3 months in both arms. Beta-cell function will be assessed by serial measurement of C-peptide in response to a standardised mixed meal tolerance test (MMTT). MMTTs will be conducted at baseline, 6-,12- and 24 months post diagnosis. The primary outcome is the between group difference in the area under the stimulated C-peptide curve (AUC) of the MMTT at 12 month post diagnosis. Secondary outcomes include between group differences in stimulated C-peptide AUC over 24 months, differences in glycaemic control as assessed by HbA1c, time spent in glucose target range, glucose variability, hypo- and hyperglycaemia as recorded by periodically applied CGM, as well as insulin requirements and change in bodyweight. Additionally, cognitive, emotional and behavioural characteristics of participating subjects and parents will be assessed, and a cost utility analysis on the benefits of closed loop insulin delivery will be performed. Safety evaluation comprises assessment of the frequency of severe hypoglycaemic episodes, diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) and number, nature and severity of other adverse events."

            "There is a fundamental gap in understanding the maternal and neonatal effects of antenatal corticosteroid (ACS) administration in women with threatened preterm birth (PTB) who have diabetes. Since the initial discovery of ACS for neonatal benefit in 1972, more than 40 randomized controlled trials have been performed evaluating its efficacy. However, none of these trials have included women with T2DM, and there is limited data among women with gestational diabetes. While ACS have been shown to reduce neonatal morbidity associated with PTB in non-diabetic women, the side effects of ACS (maternal hyperglycemia and fetal hyperinsulinemia) may mitigate the neonatal benefit of ACS in women with diabetes. Before neonatal benefit of ACS can be evaluated in this population, the first step is to optimize maternal glycemic control after ACS. Previous studies evaluating maternal hyperglycemia after ACS have been limited by small sample size, retrospective study design, or insufficient glucose data. Use of continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) in a randomized clinical trial provides a unique opportunity to overcome these challenges. Our long-term goal is to improve maternal and child health among women with diabetes as an independently funded clinical researcher. The research objectives of this proposal are to test the efficacy of three treatment strategies at achieving maternal glycemic control after ACS and evaluate the association between maternal glycemic control and neonatal outcomes. Our central hypothesis is that treatment with a continuous insulin infusion will improve maternal glycemic control, which is key to improving neonatal outcomes, but at the cost of less patient satisfaction and more health resource utilization. This hypothesis will be tested by pursuing the following specific aims: 1) Test the efficacy of three treatment strategies (addition of sliding scale insulin, up-titration of home insulin, and continuous insulin infusion) at achieving maternal glycemic control after ACS and 2) Quantify the association between maternal glycemic control after ACS and neonatal morbidity. Completion of these aims will determine the optimal strategy to achieve maternal glycemic control after ACS and inform a larger, multicenter trial to improve neonatal outcomes among women with diabetes and threatened PTB."

            "The purpose of this study is to gather feedback on a new continuous glucose monitor (CGM), called DEXCOM One. Unlike some other CGMs which allow a low (hypoglycaemic) and a high (hyperglycaemic) glucose alarm to be set, the DEXCOM One sensor has the unique feature of the 'Sustained Hyperglycaemic Alert', where the alarm is only activated if the glucose is above a certain threshold for a pre-specified amount of time. International consensus guidance states that people with diabetes should aim for 70% time in the range 3.9-10 mmol/L. After meals there is usually a rise in blood glucose, so it is not unexpected for the glucose to go above 10 mmol/L for a short time even if the insulin dose already given before a meal is correct. Therefore, people with a high glucose alarm set at 10 mmol/L on their GCM may unnecessarily inject extra insulin and risk a low blood glucose. However, DEXCOM One's Sustained Hyperglycaemic Alert would only notify patients if their blood sugar was high for a prolonged period, and so may reflect a time when it would be genuinely advantageous to inject more insulin. The aim of this single-centre, non-randomised, observational study is to gather experience from a range of users to assess the utility of this unique attribute, and the optimal settings. We aim to recruit 80-100 patients, and each participant's involvement is in 2 phases\u037e for the first 3 months DEXCOM One sensors will be used, and for months 4-6 there will be the option of continuing to use the DEXCOM One sensors with the addition of a FitBit to track physical activity."

The glycemic disorders in diabetes are not solely limited to fasting and postprandial hyperglycemia, but can be extended to the glycemic variability that includes both upward (postprandial glucose increments) and downward (interprandial glucose decrements) changes. Glycemic variability, as a component of the glycemic disorders, has more deleterious effects than sustained chronic hyperglycemia in the development of diabetic complications. Glycemic variability is associated with increased risks of adverse pregnancy outcomes in GDM. Hyperglycemic excursion has been shown to be the strongest predictor of macrosomia, the most common complication of pregnancy with diabetes. When compared with routine standard antenatal care, continuous glucose monitoring system (CGMS) guided treatments should signi\ufb01cantly improve glycemic control, lower infant birth weight, and reduce risk of macrosomia in gestational women with diabetes. We will investigate the following questions (1) Whether CGMS can detect greater glycemic variability in women with an early GDM diagnosis; (2) Whether CGMS can subsequently moderate treatment strategies of GDM especially patient behavior and glucose levels; (3) Whether CGMS can eventually improve maternal (i.e., reduce gestational weight gain and lower glycemic levels during pregnancy) and fetal outcomes (reduce LGA babies and C-section rate) compared with traditional self-monitored blood glucose (SMBG) use."

            "Diabetes type two is a debilitating disease that leads to chronic morbidity such as accelerated microvascular disease. Accelerated microvascular disease may produce blindness, end stage renal disease, myocardial infarction, stroke, and limb ischemia. Strategies to prevent or delay microvascular disease have the potential to improve the lives of millions and prevent catastrophic illness. The major focus of prevention of microvascular disease in diabetes has been on the endothelium and its role in protection of blood vessels. An unexpected means to prevent microvascular disease in diabetes may be coupled to the function of vitamin C in red blood cells (RBCs) of diabetic subjects. Based on new and emerging data, vitamin C concentrations in RBCs may be inversely related to glucose concentrations found in diabetes. Based on animal data, we hypothesize that RBCs with low vitamin C levels may have decreased deformability, leading to slower flow in capillaries and microvascular hypoxia, the hallmark of diabetic microangiopathy. Low vitamin C concentrations in RBCs of diabetic subjects may be able to be increased, by using vitamin C supplements. Findings in animals may not accurately reflect effects in humans because of species differences in mechanisms of vitamin C entry into RBCs. Therefore, clinical research is essential to characterize vitamin C physiology in RBCs of diabetic subjects. In this protocol we will investigate physiology of vitamin C in RBCs of diabetic subjects as a function of glycemia, without vitamin C supplementation (arm 1) and with vitamin C supplementation (arm 2). We will screen type II diabetic subjects on insulin and/or oral hypoglycemic medication(s) and select those with hemoglobin A1C concentrations of less than or equal to 12%. Selected subjects may be hospitalized twice, each time for approximately one week. The primary objective of the first hospitalization (arm 1) will be to evaluate the effect of hyperglycemia on vitamin C RBC physiology regardless of baseline vitamin C concentrations (without any vitamin C supplementation). The second hospitalization (arm 2) investigates the effect (if any) of vitamin C supplementation to changes in RBC physiology during euglycemic and hyperglycemic states. As inpatients, subjects will have two venous sampling periods each of approximately 24 hours. On admission, subjects may be fitted with continuous glucose monitors (CGMs), oral hypoglycemic agents will be discontinued, and basal-bolus insulin regimen initiated. Insulin doses will be clinically determined and titrated to achieve euglycemia (fasting and pre-meal glucoses <140mg/dl) prior to the first sampling period (euglycemic sampling). The first sampling period will be performed under conditions of euglycemic control for 24 hours. The second sampling period will be performed under controlled hyperglycemia induced by withholding basal and bolus insulin and providing a high carbohydrate load diet (70-75% carbohydrate). Correction-scale insulin will be provided for glucoses >350-400mg/dl. Hyperglycemia will not exceed 9 hours, and will be reversed by reinstituting insulin. During the two sampling periods, samples will be withdrawn via venous catheter for RBC deformability, vitamin C concentrations and other related research studies. Following completion of arm 1, subjects considered for participation in arm 2 will be provided a prescription for vitamin C 500mg twice daily. Given that vitamin C and vitamin E are related antioxidants, and that both vitamins appear to be associated with RBC rigidity, diabetic subjects may also be given a prescription for 400 international units (IU) of vitamin E (RRR alpha tocopherol) daily. Subjects will continue vitamin C and E supplementation for a minimum of 8 weeks depending on RBC vitamin C concentrations. To evaluate any effect of vitamin E supplementation, plasma and RBC vitamin E levels may be measured concurrently with vitamin C levels during various phases of arms 1 and 2. All subjects will be seen as outpatients at biweekly or monthly intervals with regular measurement of plasma and RBC vitamin C concentrations. Target RBC vitamin C concentration >30uM is required prior to arm 2 inpatient sampling studies. Vitamins C and E supplementation will be discontinued upon inpatient admission for arm 2. Risk of both vitamin supplements are minimal as both supplementation doses are safe. Outcomes are to measure RBC rigidity and vitamin concentrations before and after supplementation. After a minimum of 8 weeks (depending on RBC vitamin C levels), subjects will be hospitalized again, and sampling repeated as described. In this manner, each subject serves as his/her own control, and deformability of red blood cells can be determined in relation to glycemia and to vitamin C concentrations in RBCs and plasma.

            "Inpatient management of glycemia in people with diabetes has been inadequately studied. Previous randomized trials of intensive insulin therapy in the hospital setting resulted in excessive hypoglycemia. Current ADA guidelines (glucose 140-180 mg/dL) are by consensus with the upper bound defined by observational data and the lower bound by safety concerns. None of the previous studies of intensive glucose management used CGM technology. Whether near normal glucose levels can be achieved without increasing hypoglycemia among hospitalized patients with diabetes with the advent of CGM technology is not known. There are clear associations between hyperglycemia and poor outcomes in patients with diabetes hospitalized with infection, including COVID-19. The COVID-19 pandemic has increased the urgency to definitively answer the question of whether glucose lowering below 140-180 mg/dL can be achieved without increasing hypoglycemia. If this proposed study demonstrates intensive management of glucose to a target of 90 to 130 mg/dL without hypoglycemia is achievable in the inpatient setting with CGM technology, a larger study could then be performed to evaluate whether there is clinical benefit including a reduction in morbidity and mortality. The primary study hypothesis is that glucose management with CGM can achieve a mean glucose of 90-130 mg/dL without increasing hypoglycemia compared with standard care with a glucose target of 140-180 mg/dL. Individuals with diabetes who are hospitalized (non-ICU) for an eligible condition will be randomly assigned to receive standard therapy (glucose target 140-180 mg/dL per ADA guidelines) or intensive therapy (glucose target 90-130 mg/dL and CGM used for monitoring). Real-time CGM will be used in the Intensive Target Group and masked CGM will be used in the Standard Target Group. The co-primary outcomes, assessed via a hierarchical approach, include a treatment group comparison of mean glucose (superiority) followed by a non-inferiority comparison of time <54 mg/dL measured with CGM."

Hypoglycemia risk is higher during and after physical activity, especially aerobic activity of long duration. Fear of hypoglycemia can result in avoidance of exercise or overcompensatory eating, both related to worse metabolic control and increased cardiometabolic risk. Hybrid closed-loop (HCL)systems have significantly improved risk of hypoglycemia. They also offer the possibility to set a temporary target for physical activity, further reducing the risk of hypoglycemia during physical activity. Although temporary target seems to work rather well with moderate-intensity aerobic exercise, little data is available for other types of exercise, like resistance exercise, high-intensity interval exercise, combined modalities of exercise, in which the temporary target seems to perform less well.

A recent epidemiological study showed that patients with T1D have a two-fold CV mortality risk, even in case of good glycemic control. In addition, it has been shown that patients with T1D with no traditional CV risk factors had about a 80% higher risk of cardiovascular event compared to non-diabetic individuals. This indicates that further modifiable risk factors in relation to CV mortality remain to be identified. One of the candidates that could help to disentangle the factors associated with the increased CV mortality in T1D patients is glycemic variability which could contribute to diabetes complications. Indeed, severe hypoglycaemia, one of the most severe consequence of glycaemic variability, are associated with a higher mortality in patients with type 1 and type 2 diabetes. In order to evaluate the relation between glycemic variability, insulin therapy modalities and CV risk as well as some other questions related to health determinants of T1D, we are building up a large observational, prospective, multi-centric cohort study of patients gathering 15,000 patients with T1D, age above 6 years old, to perform the following: - Collecting clinical information - Evaluating Glycemic variability (assessed by the coefficient of variation of glucose (CV) calculated from automatically downloaded continuous glucose monitoring data (CGM) - Biobanking including plasma, DNA, urine, saliva and hair. - Collecting patients' reported outcomes through auto-questionnaires (online questionnaires). - Doing an active follow-up for a period of 10 years with an intermediate visit every 3 years. - Passive follow-up: link to national Health data system (Syst\u00e8me National de Donn\u00e9es de Sant\u00e9, SNDS) in order to exhaustively collect health events as death, CV events and hospitalizations (including severe hypoglycemia)."

            "In type 1 diabetes, it is common to choose the food we eat according to the blood sugar level and the insulin dose and vice versa. Beyond the nutritional aspects, the relationship to food and the resulting eating behaviors can be a source of suffering. Also, it has been reported that one out of two people over 60 years of age living with type 1 diabetes has cognitive impairment. Changes in cognitive functions can have important implications for daily well-being, diet (e.g., the ability to modulate cravings), and treatment decisions to manage diabetes. One factor that can affect both eating behaviors and cognitive function is variation in blood glucose levels. This research aims to better understand the impact of glycemic variability in disordered eating behaviors and cognitive impairment, and its consequences on self-management skills in people with type 1 diabetes. The hypotheses are that i) higher glycemic variability is associated with higher disordered eating behaviors and poorer cognitive function in people with type 1 diabetes, and that differences exist between sexes, ii) higher disordered eating behaviors and poorer cognitive function are associated with lower self-management skills; and iii) cognitive impairment, interoception awareness and insulin resistance may mediate the relationship between glycemic variability and disordered eating behaviors. This research study will contribute to highlighting the consequences of blood sugar fluctuations, \"sugar swings\", in daily life, in particular the way they disrupt eating behaviors and brain function. A better understanding of the mechanisms involved could eventually allow for early detection and management of these problems.

            "Overweight and obesity are increasingly prevalent worldwide. These bodyweight disorders are closely related to deficiencies in the control of food intake. A potential yet unexplored mechanism to explain the loss of eating control is the interaction between the gut microbiota and the brain. The mechanisms underlying the communication between the gut microbiome and the host remain largely unexplored. These mechanisms could occur in part through small non-coding RNAs, called microRNAs (miRNAs). miRNAs regulate epigenetic mechanisms to control gene expression. Two hypotheses have been proposed: I. The interaction between the gut microbiota and the brain and its associated epigenetic changes play an important role in the overweight-related loss of eating control and metabolic imbalance. II.The composition and functionality of the gut microbiota are associated with circulating microRNAs and glycemic variability and modify the effect of physical activity on cognitive parameters and brain microstructure (R2*).

            "The overall survival of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and lymphoma in children and adolescents is above 90%. The survival rate has increased significantly during the last decades as a consequence of more intensive chemotherapy. This very toxic treatment results in severe acute toxicities and late effects, which is the biggest challenge today besides survival. The overall purpose of contemporary ALL treatment is to reduce the toxic treatment without compromising the excellent survival rates of these diseases. This study is a part of this. The researchers want to investigate the incidence of glucose intolerance and medicine induced diabetes during treatment for ALL and lymphoma with steroids (prednisolone or dexamethasone) and \u00b1 PEG-asparaginase. Steroids and asparaginase are used in the treatment of ALL and lymphomas, and both drugs may induce glucose intolerance or diabetes, especially when they are given concomitantly. The incidence and duration of increased blood glucose levels are not very well investigated, and especially not monitored continuously during treatment phases with steroids and +/- asparaginase, as the investigators want to do in this study. In the study the participants must have a glucose sensor attached under the skin, which continuously measures blood glucose during treatment. Moreover, blood samples are drawn several times to measure insulin sensitivity and beta cell function. The participants are children and adolescents (1.0-17.9 years) with newly diagnosed ALL or lymphoma treated at one of the four Danish pediatric oncology sites. Blood glucose levels are followed during treatment with steroids and PEG-asparaginase in these patient groups. The results may give rise to a new treatment guidelines for measuring and treating blood glucose in these patients. In the future this may help reduce the development of type 2 diabetes mellitus and metabolic syndrome in survivors of ALL and lymphoma."

Materials and methods To this study, patients qualified for elective total knee or hip replacement in the single orthopedic center will be recruited. 100 patients will be included in this study. Every patient will be evaluated on the risk of developing diabetes mellitus in 10 years time and on the risk of death in 10 years due to the cardiovascular events. 14 days before procedure patients will have continuous glucose level measurement sensor implemented in subcutaneous tissue. After 14 days, during standard visit for stitches removal, the sensor will be removed and glycemia data will be collected. Next, patients will have their casual glucose blood level checked and surgery outcome, cardiovascular events or surgery complication risk evaluated in 3-, 6- and 12 month follow-up visits. Expected benefits of the study Results of this study may allow to define impact of orthopaedic treatment on glycemia and possible necessity to modify treatment of hyperglycemia in perioperative period in patients with Diabetes Mellitus type 2 (DM2). Moreover it will allow to specify change of glucose levels and possibly implicating a need to monitor perioperative glycemia in patients without carbohydrate metabolism disorders. Additionally, the study will help to evaluate corelation between perioperative glucose blood level and the risk of cardiovascular events or surgical complications in 1-year after the procedure, which may decrease the risk of such incidents in the future (e.g. by adequate control and effective treatment of hyperglycemia), hence may result in reduction of mortality and lesser lowering of the quality of life in patients with DM2 or high risk of it."

Despite the well-known side-effects, GC treatment is widely used. Oral GC therapy leads to a rapid and profound effects on bone metabolism, with increased osteoblast apoptosis and prolonged osteoclast survival, which increases bone resorption, resulting in bone loss, and a subsequent increased fracture risk. Within days of high dose oral GC, glucose tolerance decreases and bone turnover is shifted in favour of less bone formation and increased bone resorption. Bone formation and bone resorption can be estimated by measuring serum bone turnover markers. The gut microbiota is involved in regulating bone metabolism and recently it was demonstrated that Lactobacillus reuteri 6475 (LR) could reduce bone loss over 12 months by half in older women. In a recent experimental study, it was discovered that mice treated either with broad spectrum antibiotics, eradicating gut microbiota, or with LR did not experience GC induced bone loss in the spine and femur. L. reuteri has been widely studied in clinical trials and has been shown to have probiotic, health-promoting effects in both adults and children. The aim of this planned randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial is to investigate if daily supplementation with LR, compared to placebo, can prevent the negative effects of oral glucocorticoid (GC) on bone turnover and on blood glucose regulation in healthy young adult men and women. If LR is able to prevent deleterious side effects, such as bone loss and impaired glucose tolerance, of oral GC treatment, the probiotic could potentially be recommended and used to improve health in a substantial yearly number of patients treated with GC."

Can (changes in) CGM-derived glycemic variability indices predict/detect dysglycemia in initially normoglycemic (single or multiple autoantibody-positive) relatives with the same diagnostic efficiency as OGTT- or clamp-derived variables? 3. Can (changes in) CGM-derived glycemic variability indices predict clinical onset in (stage 1 or 2) multiple autoantibody-positive relatives with the same diagnostic efficiency as OGTT- or clamp-derived variables? 4. Can correlating (changes in) CGM-derived indices with (changes in) OGTT- and clamp-derived variables help to better understand the sequence of events leading to dysglycemia and clinical onset, as well as the relative contribution of beta cell function and insulin action to glycemic variability according to disease stage and biological and phenotypical characteristics of the relatives?"

            "Background: Post-transplant hyperglycaemia occurs frequently in renal transplant recipients within the first two weeks after transplantation. Standard-of-care is primarily based on insulin treatment with the adherent risk of hypoglycaemia and weight gain. Semaglutide produces an effective lowering of plasma glucose in diabetes patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) and leads to a reduction in weight and the incidence of hypoglycaemia. The efficacy of semaglutide is untested in renal transplant recipients, and safety concerns remain, primarily on renal graft function. Objectives: The primary objective is to establish whether tablet semaglutide (Rybelsus) compared with placebo, both as add-on to standard-of-care, is non-inferior in regulating plasma glucose in patients with hyperglycaemia after renal transplantation. Secondary objectives aim to evaluate the effect of tablet semaglutide on renal graft function, weight, use of insulin, cardiovascular parameters and safety parameters (plasma semaglutide concentration, gastrointestinal side effects, dose of immunosuppressants). Design: An investigator-initiated, placebo-controlled, double-blinded, parallel-group, randomised trial. Population: Patients (n = 104) with post-transplant hyperglycaemia and an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) > 15 ml/min/1.73 m2. Methods: Participants diagnosed with post-transplant hyperglycaemia, 10 to 15 days post-transplant, will be randomised 1:1 to either 14 weeks of tablet semaglutide once daily or placebo both as add-on to standard glucose-lowering therapy. Participants will maintain weekly contact with the clinic during the first five weeks and at two to four weeks intervals during the remaining study period. During the trial, each patient will be monitored according to blood laboratory values with safety assessed at every visit by a nephrologist. Pre-prandial plasma glucose will be measured in the morning and evening to adjust glucose-lowering therapy after consultation with an endocrinologist. Double blinded continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) will be performed for 10-14 days from baseline and at weeks 5, 9, and 13. Primary endpoint: - Mean sensor glucose (mmol/L) evaluated by CGM Key secondary endpoints: - Incidence of hypoglycaemia - Body weight (kg) - Creatinine (\u03bcmol/L) - Daily insulin dose (IE per day) - Plasma concentration of semaglutide (nmol/L) - Blood concentrations of cyclosporine and tacrolimus (\u03bcg/L)"

Methods: parallel, randomised, controlled, clinical trial will be carried out, with a total of 90 participants. Exercise modality that showed the best glycaemic control in first phase of GLYCEX study (NCT05612698) will be used. Participantds will be randomised in 3 groups: 1) frequency of 5 days/week, 2) frequency of 3 days/week and 3) frequency of 2 days/week. Data collection will be performed at baseline and after 15-weeks of follow up. Sociodemographic data, medication, comorbidity, blood biochemical parameters, blood pressure, anthropometric measurements, body composition, physical activity, sedentary lifestyle, diet, smoking, alcohol consumption, quality of life and sleep questionnaires will be collected. Physical activity, sedentary behaviour and sleep will be further determined with an accelerometer, and continuous glycaemia will be determined with a glycaemic monitor, both during seven days, in two time points. The main dependent variable will be the reduction of the mean amplitude of glycaemic excursions. The impact of the interventions on health will also be evaluated through gene expression analysis in peripheral blood cells. Discussion: The results of this study will contribute to better understanding of the response of glucose mechanisms to physical exercise in a population with prediabetes as well as improving physical exercise prescriptions for diabetes prevention. Increasing glycaemic control in people with prediabetes through physical exercise offers an opportunity to prevent diabetes and reduce associated comorbidities and health costs."

            "The CGMS in GDM Labor and Delivery Study",
            "Glucose control during labor is important for both fetus and mother. During labor and delivery, the goal is to maintain the sugars in the normal range as safely as possible as increased blood sugars 4-6 h prior to delivery leads to increased rates of hypoglycemia in the neonate. Neonatal hypoglycemia is a risk for the offspring of pregnant women with diabetes and occurs when fetal pancreatic hyperplasia is acutely stimulated by a high fetal glucose level derived from maternal hyperglycemia during labor. The maternal blood glucose level during delivery is a predictor of the neonatal blood glucose level. Modern continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) systems can capture the direction and magnitude of short-lived changes in interstitial glucose levels and are therefore useful for assessing glucose variability more accurately than self-monitoring blood glucose (SMBG) measurements. Indeed, it has already been demonstrated that intermittent blood glucose monitoring underestimates the number of hyperglycemic events, because blood glucose excursions can peak at different times of day. CGMs can help identify glycemic patterns in pregnancy, obtain and maintain glucose targets, and reduce hypoglycemia. Strict glycemic control during labor and delivery may reduce the risk of neonatal hypoglycemia. Two groups have reported on the use of CGM in type 1 diabetics during labor in small pilot studies. Another study looked at effects of maternal glucose levels in insulin-treated women during labor and delivery (2 to 8 h before birth) and resultant neonatal hypoglycemia. The researchers found that maternal hyperglycemia before delivery was correlated with neonatal hypoglycemia. Although more studies are needed, CGM use has promise as a therapy to improve outcomes in pregnancies associated with diabetes. In this study, the investigators plan to explore whether the use of blinded glucose monitoring during labor, delivery, and early postpartum supplementary to normally monitored plasma glucose measurements in women with gestational diabetes (GDM) would provide useful information to improve glycemia during labor in this diabetic population. All CGM data will be masked and therefore not available to participants, clinicians, or researchers at the time of delivery. Participants otherwise will receive standard clinical care. The blinded glucose monitoring data on glycemia throughout labor and post-delivery will be retrospectively assessed."

The project evaluates the use of the Artificial Pancreas (or closed loop system) in very young children with type 1 diabetes (T1D) aged 1 to 7 years. The suggested trial is an outcome study to determine whether 24/7 automated closed loop glucose control will improve glucose control as measured by time in range compared to sensor augmented pump therapy. In the extension phase, the purpose is to evaluate the effect of long-term home use of 24/7 automated hybrid closed loop insulin delivery on glucose control (UK sites only). The study adopts an open-label, multi-centre, multi-national, randomised, two period, cross-over design study, comparing two 16-week periods during which glucose levels will be controlled either by a closed loop system (intervention period) or by sensor augmented pump therapy (control period). Participants will complete a 2 to 4 week run-in period, followed by two treatment periods that will last 16 weeks each, with a 1 to 4 week washout period in between. The order of the two treatments will be random. A total of up to 80 young children aged 1 to 7 years with T1D on insulin pump therapy (aiming for 72 randomised subjects) will be recruited through paediatric outpatient diabetes clinics of the investigation centres. Prior to the use of study devices, participants and parents/guardians will receive appropriate training by the research team on the safe use of the study pump and continuous glucose monitoring device, and the hybrid closed loop insulin delivery system. Carers at nursery or school may also receive training by the study team if required. During the closed loop study arm, subjects and parents/guardians will use the closed loop system for 16 weeks under free-living conditions in their home and nursery/school environment without remote monitoring or supervision by research staff. During the control study arm, subjects and parents/guardians will use sensor augmented pump therapy for 16 weeks under free-living conditions in their home and nursery/school environment. All subjects will have regular contact with the study team during the home study phase including 24/7 telephone support. The primary endpoint is time spent in target range, between 3.9 and 10.0 mmol/l as recorded by CGM. Secondary outcomes are the time spent with glucose levels above and below target, as recorded by CGM, and other CGM-based metrics. Safety evaluation comprises assessment of the frequency and severity of hypoglycaemic episodes and diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). During the extension phase, participants will have follow-up contacts every 3 months. The primary endpoint is time spent in target range, between 3.9 and 10.0 mmol/l as recorded by CGM, over 18 months from the end of the primary phase, as compared to sensor augmented pump therapy during the primary phase.

Investigators currently have powerful and reliable methods allowing us to carry out nights at home in the patient's ecosystem, in real-life conditions. The characterization of sleep parameters by these methods is equivalent to a polysomnographic recording. These technological innovations will allow us to characterize sleep before the initiation of CPAP treatment during several nights performed at home. Investigators will then be able to characterize the kinetics and stability of the improvement of sleep parameters in patients with obstructive sleep apnea syndrome in whom continuous positive airway pressure is initiated.

Sleep disorders are the first cause of complaint in patients with PTSD due to night awakenings, difficulty to fall asleep and nightmares. According to a part of the scientific community, replicative traumatic nightmares represent PTSD's basis mechanism. Traumatic nightmares generate disabling symptoms such as anxiety reactions, while maintaining the symptoms by depriving the individual of good quality sleep. Traumatic nightmares may thus be a sign of PTSD seriousness and chronicity, although their physiological basis remain poorly known. In the military population, which is highly exposed to psychological traumatism, PTSD prevalence is very high and is associated with severe intensity patterns, a very high frequency of replicative nightmares and a low response to conventional therapies."

From the literature and preliminary results obtained in our clinical research unit, it appears that there is also a relationship between certain characteristics of the peroperative EEG (signal strength and burst suppression) and the occurrence of postoperative cognitive dysfunction (PCOD). In this context, quantitative analysis of the preoperative sleep EEG and the EEG obtained during general anesthesia could allow the identification of a simple to use biomarker of susceptibility or fragility. To our knowledge, there is no preoperative evaluation strategy using EEG analysis to detect a predisposition to POCD.

The first-line KOA management is nonsurgical care, with education and exercise therapy as key elements. Nevertheless, treatment effects of exercise therapy and behavioral pain management on improvements in pain, function and quality of life are small to moderate at best. This shows that there is an urgent need for better KOA care. The innovative solution may lie in thinking beyond joints, by targeting KOA subgroups through comorbidity-specific interventions, which fits well in the global move towards precision medicine. With a prevalence rate up to 50%, the presence of insomnia symptoms is a highly prevalent KOA comorbidity, contributing to symptom severity. If left untreated, it represents a barrier for effective conservative management. Since insomnia is nowadays hardly addressed in the often joint-targeted KOA care, the scientific objectives of the study are to assess 1) if cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) integrated in best-evidence usual care, consisting of education and exercise therapy, (CBTi-UC) is more effective than best-evidence usual care alone (UC), i.e. education and exercise therapy, at 6 months follow-up in improving clinical outcomes and 2) if CBTi-UC is more cost-effective than UC in KOA patients with comorbid insomnia."

            "Personalising Children's Screen Use Reduction for Better Sleep, Mental, and Brain Health",
            "In Singapore, 64.4% of school-age children sleep less than the minimum recommended duration of 9 hours on school nights, thus risking poor mental, cognitive, and brain health. These short-sleeping children, however, spend on average 2.5 hours per school day on non-academic media use, revealing the potential of reducing their screen time for more sleep. Previous interventions targeted at reducing media use and/or improving sleep among school-age children, though effective in increasing sleep, required cooperation from schools, extensive personnel training, and high commitment of participants, rendering them difficult to implement in Singapore. Existing interventions also focused on evening or pre-bedtime screen use, and took a one-size-fits-all approach, ignoring individual differences in the duration, type, and purpose of media use throughout the day. Here, we propose a scalable approach to curtail media use based on individual need throughout the day. We will conduct a randomised controlled trial during term time, recruiting 150 children, aged 6-12 years, who on school days, sleep less than 8 hours and spend more than 2 hours on media use. At baseline, all participants will record their time use patterns. The research staff will then help the intervention group to repurpose at least 60 minutes of media use per school day for sleep. Importantly, participants can decide the type, timing and duration of media use to curtail, thus giving them a sense of agency and mastery, while boosting their self-efficacy, a vital ingredient in behavioural change. The intervention group will follow this personalised schedule for 2 weeks, while the control group will be in a free-living condition. Two weeks after the intervention has ended, the intervention group will undergo follow-up assessments. Throughout the study, sleep, time use, cognitive functions, and psychological well-being will be assessed daily. Other cognitive tasks and questionnaires will be conducted during 2-3 lab/school-classroom visits, with one-third of the participants also undergoing high-density electroencephalography to measure brain activity."

Studies show that there is a lack of evidence-based guidelines for the design of parental support in maternal health care. Early labour or latent phase of labour is the part of childbirth were women often feel insecure, in stress and left out from care. First-time mothers who have no experience of one labour before are particularly vulnerable. Many women today use digital applications during pregnancy and in connection with childbirth. There are several digital applications that will help the woman by guiding her and her partner in different decisions about labour, but it is necessary to offer evidence-based, credible electronic and digital solutions for expectant parents. A meta-synthesis from 2018 showed that women use the internet often and the information they receive there has a great influence on their different choices in connection with childbirth. Volume, accessibility, and convenience about digital solutions play a crucial role for women and partners. The digital application Contraction Coper is designed and tested by the company Birth By Heart \u00a9 in order to facilitate in early labour for the pregnant woman and her partner. The overall purpose of the project is to evaluate whether the application Contraction Coper can contribute to reduced anxiety and stress during pregnancy and childbirth and whether an additional support from a midwife can increase the application use and satisfaction of women when using the application. A randomized controlled trial is planned where first-time mothers after pregnancy week 25 are invited to participation via social platforms. Participating first-time mothers are randomly assigned to one of three groups; experiment group one, which gets access to the application Contraction Coper, experiment group two Contraction Coper Plus which gets access to both the application and support of midwives, so-called \"blended\" care, or three, the control group offered customary maternity care only.

The investigators' prior work has demonstrated that gamification, a method commonly used for health promotion, can lead to sustained increases in physical activity if it is designed using insights from behavioral economics to enhance social incentives. In this study, the investigators will compare the effectiveness of behaviorally designed gamification that encourages Veterans to collaborate or compete on physical activity levels and examine clinical outcomes as well as costs, barriers and facilitators to implementation of the program within Veterans Affairs."

            "Background: Communication of information about risk of type 2 diabetes (T2D) alone has not been associated with changes in habitual behaviors among individuals of European ancestry. In contrast, the use of wearable devices that monitor physical activity (PA) has been associated with changes in behavior in some studies. It is uncertain whether risk communication might enhance the effects of wearable devices. We aim to assess the effects on wearable-device-measured PA of communicating genetic risk for T2D alone or in combination with goal setting and activity prompts from a wearable device among overweight or obese East Asians. Methods: In a parallel group, randomized controlled trial, a total of 355 overweight or obese East Asian individuals aged 40-60 years will be allocated into one of three groups: 1 control and 2 intervention groups. Blood samples will be used for estimation of T2D genetic risk and analysis of metabolic risk markers. Genetic risk of T2D will be estimated based on 113 SNPs associated with T2D among East Asians using an established method. All three groups will receive a Fitbit device. Both intervention groups will be given T2D genetic risk estimates along with lifestyle advice, but one of the intervention groups will additionally use Fitbit's step-goal setting and prompt functions. Questionnaires and physical measurements will be administered at baseline, immediately after intervention delivery, and 6 and 12-month post-intervention following standard operating procedures. The primary outcome is time spent in moderate-to-vigorous PA measured through the Fitbit. Secondary outcomes include other parameters of wearable-device-measured PA, sedentary time, and sleep, body mass index, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, five intermediate metabolic risk markers, hand grip strength, self-reported PA, self-reported fruit and vegetable consumption and smoking status, and a list of psychological variables. Discussion: This study will be the first randomized controlled trial using the combination of communication of T2D genetic risk with standard functions of wearable devices in any population. Findings will inform strategies to prevent T2D through lifestyle modification."

Improvements in bioimpedance and aerobic capacity will be analysed as secondary variables, as well as possible determinants of vascular function that guarantee the sustainability of the effect (pulse wave velocity, endothelial function, metabolic profile and other plasma biomarkers), and all of them will be correlated with the evolution of the disease (admission due to clinical deterioration). 2) Studies in a murine experimental model: Mice with pulmonary hypertension induced by the administration of SU5416 (sugen) and exposure to hypoxia for 3 weeks will be studied after a three-week rehabilitation program. Half of them will exercise 1-2 days a week for 4 more weeks. At the end of the program, the right ventricular pressure will be measured and subsequently the animals will be sacrificed.

The impact of exercise training on LV structure has been extensively studied. Left ventricular hypertrophy and cardiac chamber enlargement with the accompanying ability to generate a large stroke volume are direct results of exercise training. Aerobic exercise therapy offers a non-pharmacological mechanism to modulate multiple gene expression pathways that may promote cardiac remodeling. No prior studies have investigated the efficacy of aerobic exercise in the prevention or treatment of anthracycline-induced cardiotoxicity. We hypothesize that exercise intervention leads to a reverse in adverse cardiac remodeling with improvement of global and regional myocardial function in patients exposed to anthracycline."

Unfortunately, since physical activity support is not a part of standard survivorship care, few survivors have access to efficacious MVPA interventions. A key barrier to translation of MVPA promotion into care is the design of existing programs, which are resource-intensive, costly, and deliver multiple components (i.e., coaching calls, supervised exercise) simultaneously to all participants.

            "Atrial Fibrillation (AF) is an abnormal heart rhythm. Because AF is often asymptomatic, it often remains undiagnosed in the early stages. Anticoagulant therapy greatly reduces the risks of stroke in patients diagnosed with AF. However, diagnosis of AF requires long-term ambulatory monitoring procedures that are burdensome and/or expensive. Smart devices (such as Apple or Fitbit) use light sensors (called \"photoplethysmography\" or PPG) and motion sensors (called \"accelerometers\") to continuously record biometric data, including heart rhythm. Smart devices are already widely adopted. This study seeks to validate an investigational machine-learning software (also called \"algorithms\") for the long-term monitoring and detection of abnormal cardiac rhythms using biometric data collected from consumer smart devices. The research team aims to enroll 500 subjects who are being followed after a stroke event of uncertain cause at the Emory Stroke Center. Subjects will undergo standard long-term cardiac monitoring (ECG), using FDA-approved wearable devices fitted with skin electrodes or implantable continuous recorders, and backed by FDA-approved software for abnormal rhythm detection. Patients will wear a study-provided consumer wrist device at home, for the 30 days of ECG monitoring, 23 hours a day. At the end of the 30 days, the device data will be uploaded to a secure cloud server and will be analyzed offline using proprietary software (called \"algorithms\") and artificial intelligence strategies. Detection of AF events using the investigational algorithms will be compared to the results from the standard monitoring to assess their reliability. Attention will be paid to recorded motion artifacts that can affect the quality and reliability of recorded signals. The ultimate aim is to establish that smart devices can potentially be used for monitoring purposes when used with specialized algorithms. Smart devices could offer an affordable alternative to standard-of-care cardiac monitoring."

Consented participants will be enrolled in a 3-month digital health coaching program through which electronic patient reported outcomes and wearable activity data will be collected. Outcomes include treatment experience, quality of life, financial toxicity, treatment adherence, symptom burden and health self-efficacy. These will be captured by patient reported outcome measures including the Patient's Qualitative Assessment of Treatment- Real World (PQAT-RW), Patient Global Impression of Change/Severity (PGIC/S), European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire (EORTC-QLQ-C30), Quality of Life Questionnaire Multiple Myeloma (QLQ-MY20), and the European QoL-5 Dimensions (EQ5D), Cancer Behavior Inventory-Brief Form (CBI-B), Center for Adherence Support Evaluation (CASE) Medication Adherence Index, Comprehensive Score for Financial Toxicity (COST) Instrument. Clinical data, including treatment history, healthcare utilization, and co-morbidities, as well as demographic data will be collected via the electronic health record from each clinical site. This data will be complemented by qualitative data from a selected cohort of study participants with a focus on treatment experience ranging from infusion burden, toxicity management, to overall quality of life. Evaluation of this data in combination will be used to better understand the treatment experience of individuals on standard of care isatuximab-irfc specifically, and with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma generally, contributing to an existing gap in the literature regarding patient reported outcomes from diverse data sources. Outcomes will be analyzed with attention to the relationship between social determinants of health, including race, ethnicity, and geographic location, and treatment experience as reflected in both the qualitative and quantitative data."

Overwhelming numbers of AAs, a fast-growing first-generation immigrant group, suffer from type 2 diabetes (T2D) and its consequences of poorly controlled blood glucose. For the older AAs, there are higher prevalence rates, worse diabetes control, and higher rates of complications due to limited English proficiency and health literacy. Despite the evidence concerning the effects of dietary interventions on glycemic control by well-controlled feeding studies in mainstream Americans, a lack of clinical trials of culturally tailored interventions often imposes serious barriers to translate and implement such fruitful and innovative approaches in individuals from ethnic minority communities such as AAs. The proposed study will use a randomized, controlled design with a sample of 60 AAs aged 65 years or older. Metabolomics methodologies will be incorporated into this research to provide a global picture of metabolites' responses to personalized behavioral nutrition (PBN) intervention.

            "The purpose of this study is to gather feedback on a new continuous glucose monitor (CGM), called DEXCOM One. Unlike some other CGMs which allow a low (hypoglycaemic) and a high (hyperglycaemic) glucose alarm to be set, the DEXCOM One sensor has the unique feature of the 'Sustained Hyperglycaemic Alert', where the alarm is only activated if the glucose is above a certain threshold for a pre-specified amount of time. International consensus guidance states that people with diabetes should aim for 70% time in the range 3.9-10 mmol/L. After meals there is usually a rise in blood glucose, so it is not unexpected for the glucose to go above 10 mmol/L for a short time even if the insulin dose already given before a meal is correct. Therefore, people with a high glucose alarm set at 10 mmol/L on their GCM may unnecessarily inject extra insulin and risk a low blood glucose. However, DEXCOM One's Sustained Hyperglycaemic Alert would only notify patients if their blood sugar was high for a prolonged period, and so may reflect a time when it would be genuinely advantageous to inject more insulin. The aim of this single-centre, non-randomised, observational study is to gather experience from a range of users to assess the utility of this unique attribute, and the optimal settings. We aim to recruit 80-100 patients, and each participant's involvement is in 2 phases\u037e for the first 3 months DEXCOM One sensors will be used, and for months 4-6 there will be the option of continuing to use the DEXCOM One sensors with the addition of a FitBit to track physical activity."

There is major potential to improve Veteran engagement in CR by combining digital coaching (d-Coaching) with existing VA-supported technologies. The investigator's theory-based intervention targets a critical component of successful CR engagement that is not available through traditional programs: virtual social support through a social network. In addition, the investigators propose to improve self-efficacy and self-regulation through interactive digital multi-media education, personalized feedback, and motivation so that Veterans can complete the prescribed HBCR program and maintain physical activity long-term. This RCT will evaluate the effects of HBCR alone (usual care) versus HBCR + d-Coaching, including a private social media group (Movn), optimized Annie text messaging, VA Video Connect, and connected devices (Fitbits). The investigators will randomly assign 150 Veterans from 2 HBCR programs to a 3-month intervention. The addition of d- Coaching to existing digital technologies will be operationalized by using a private social media group to provide social support, education, personalized feedback, and motivation.

            "Approximately 1.9 million youth sustain a concussion each year, and up to 30% experience persistent post-concussive symptoms (PPCS) such as headache, dizziness, and difficulty focusing that continue for weeks or months. PPCS results in greater utilization of sub-specialty care and can impact immediate and long-term social development, cognitive function and academic success. Previous recommendations for treating PPCS have focused on cognitive and physical rest, but more recently guidelines have shifted based on new research suggesting the benefit of rehabilitative exercise for PPCS. The rationale behind using exercise to treat youth with concussion is that gradually increasing physical activity facilitates return to full function. Rehabilitative exercise has since become one of the most common approaches to treating youth with PPCS, but access is challenging since most programs require weekly centralized visits with a concussion specialist. To bridge this gap, the investigators developed a telehealth-delivered approach to treat PPCS, utilizing physical activity trackers (Fitbits) and weekly video conferences with trained research staff. They then conducted a series of pilot studies with this approach, finding excellent feasibility, acceptability, and evidence for more rapid declines in concussive symptoms compared to controls. The investigators also found preliminary evidence that mechanisms behind this intervention may stem from both physiologic processes due to increased moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) and psychologic processes such as reducing fear- avoidance of concussive symptoms. They now propose a fully-powered randomized controlled trial (RCT) to asses the efficacy of the \"Mobile Subthreshold Exercise Program\" (M-STEP) for treating youth with PPCS."

As patients with T2DM often have insufficient knowledge about proper self-management and are insufficiently motivated for a lifestyle change, interventions with more motivational strategies and personalization are needed. The use of real-time monitoring of glucose values, nutrition and physical activity in combination with coaching aimed at lifestyle-related behavior change may improve patients' diabetes management. Therefore, ZGT, UT and RRD developed the Diameter app. The aim of phase 2 of this study is to investigate the Diameter as blended-care using a feasibility study. The primary objective of this feasibility study is to assess intervention usage and acceptability of the Diameter as a blended-care intervention in secondary care, of which some are also following a combined lifestyle intervention (GLI). Secondary objectives are to explore behavioral (e.g. physical activity), physiological (e.g. BMI), psychological (e.g. health-related quality of life) and clinical outcomes (e.g. glucose control, estimated HbA1c values).

Patients will start with a two-week period of baseline measurements. Subsequently, patients will use the Diameter as a blended-care intervention for 10 weeks. The two-week measurement periods will be repeated twice (T1: week 13-14 and at T2: week 25-26). Between T1 and T2, patients will use a version of the Diameter without daily coaching messages. At T1 and T2, questionnaires will be administered, data on physical activity, food intake and glucose values will be logged, and blood and urine samples will be retrieved from regular care measurements. In addition, open-ended interviews will be performed with 10-15 patients at T1. For participants who also decided to follow the COOL program, some routinely collected measurements as part of the COOL program will be obtained from the patient record."

The identification of biomarkers that predict the likelihood of disease response would allow epilepsy patients to make more informed decisions about the factors affecting their quality of life, including plans for driving, relationships, pregnancy, schooling, work, and play. In addition to its impact on clinical care, the data and specimens collected in HEP3, including sequential electrophysiology, biochemical profiles and neuroimaging and banked DNA for future genomics studies, have the potential to provide new insights into the biological basis of IGE, thereby advancing the discovery of effective treatments and cures.

Medical treatment of COPD aims to reduce these symptoms, reduce exacerbations, and improve patients' ability to perform exercise and daily activities. TRIXEO is a triple therapy indicated as a maintenance treatment in adult patients with moderate-to-severe COPD who are not adequately treated by a combination of an inhaled corticosteroid and a long-acting beta2-agonist or combination of a long-acting beta2-agonist and a long-acting muscarinic antagonist. The RECORD study is a prospective, non-interventional study to be conducted in the United Kingdom (UK) and Germany. The study aims to generate data to describe the real world effectiveness of Trixeo for patients with COPD who receive Trixeo in routine clinical practice. It also aims describe patients HRQoL, physical activity and treatment satisfaction, and will explore patients' sleep quality and adherence to inhalers in the real-world. This data may provide important information for practicing physicians. The study will include approximately 500 patients with moderate to severe COPD from approximately 50 sites (including hospitals and GP practices) in the UK. Patients eligible for TRIXEO therapy may be enrolled by their treating physicians. The decision to treat with TRIXEO must be independent of the study and made by the treating physician according to the patients' medical need and local routine clinical practice. Patients data will be collected for 12 months after starting therapy with Trixeo. Demographic and clinical data will be extracted from patients' health care records. Patient reported outcomes will be collected remotely by asking patients to answer questionnaires on health status and HRQoL, treatment satisfaction, and inhaled medication adherence through electronic surveys.

These devices measure glucose in the skin, rather than in the blood, and provide information not only on how low glucose is, but also for how long. Recent studies showed that over half of episodes of low glucose with these systems are not recognised by people with diabetes, and even people without diabetes have sensor values that are below the current thresholds for hypoglycaemia [ low blood glucose] that we measure with traditional monitors. In this study, the investigators will evaluate the impact of symptomatic as well as asymptomatic episodes of low sensor glucose on a variety of clinical, patient-related and health economic outcomes such as mood, quality of sleep and productivity. The investigators will test different levels and durations of low sensor glucose to identify the one that best matches episodes that are symptomatic to best define hypoglycaemia using these systems.

            "Infertility affects approximately 10-15% of couples and one of its important modifiable risk factor is obesity, which affects 19% of Canadian women of reproductive age. Accordingly, many organizations have recommended that women should be assisted to adopt a healthy lifestyle prior to conception and maintain it during pregnancy. We therefore propose to conduct a multicenter randomized controlled trial (RCT) assessing the lifestyle intervention Fit-For-Fertility in women with infertility and obesity. Our hypothesis is that the Fit-For-Fertility program is an efficient and low cost solution to improve access to motherhood for women suffering from obesity and infertility. To test our hypothesis, seven fertility clinics having a good ethnic diversity will participate in this RCT and recruit a total of 616 women with obesity (BMI according to ethnicity) who consult at the fertility clinic. Participants will be randomly allocated to one of these two groups: the intervention group will be invited to participate in the Fit-for Fertility Program alone for 6 months and then in combination with usual fertility treatments; while the control group will receive standard fertility treatments from randomisation. The aim of the Fit-for Fertility Program will be to implement progressive and sustainable lifestyle changes, using 1) individual sessions with a dietitian and a kinesiologist every 6-12 weeks, for a total of 18 months or until the end of pregnancy; and 2) eight educational group sessions. Evaluation visits will take place prior to randomisation and then every 6 months for 18 months. Women who become pregnant will be evaluated early during pregnancy and at 26 weeks of gestation. Clinical outcomes will be assessed after a total follow up of 24 months. Anticipated contributions: The results of our multicenter RCT will provide important data on the importance of a lifestyle program supporting women with obesity consulting in fertility clinics, in order to improve their fertility and response to ART, as well as helping them to have a healthy baby. This study will also provide valuable information on potential cost savings for individuals and the healthcare system."

Some patients experience symptoms, specifically shortness of breath, long after the viral infection has passed. These patients are colloquially known as \"Covid-19 Long-Haulers\" and it is currently unknown why symptoms remain after infection. Shortness of breath and exercise intolerance may be caused by corona virus infection, covid-19 therapy, and reduced physical activity. Exercise intolerance may be due to lung, heart, blood vessel and muscle changes. During infection, the corona virus appears to cause lung blood vessel and gas exchange surface damage. Early reports show heart dysfunction, secondary to pulmonary blood vessel dysfunction or damage. Critically, no data is available on lung blood vessel function or cardiac function during exercise. Moreover, no data are available to link persistent symptoms to physiology parameters. To better understand symptom persistence in Covid-19, the investigators aim to measure exercise tolerance and heart and lung function in covid-19 survivors and compare them to covid-19 free controls."

The most severe and debilitated CLBP patients often have comorbidities such as overweight and obesity. Despite the growing body of scientific literature pointing towards the close interaction between overweight/obesity and CLBP, few treatment programs for people with CLBP nowadays take overweight into account. Therefore this study will examine the added value of a behavioral weight reduction program (changes in diet, behavior and physical exercise) to current best evidence rehabilitation (pain neuroscience education plus cognition-targeted exercise therapy) for overweight or obese people with CLBP. An international, multicenter randomized controlled trial comparing a behavioral weight reduction program combined with pain neuroscience education and cognition-targeted exercise therapy versus pain neuroscience education and cognition-targeted exercise therapy alone, will be conducted. The primary outcome is pain and the primary endpoint was chosen at 12 months follow-up; secondary outcomes include health care use and daily functioning (see detailed description of outcomes for an overview of all secondary outcomes).

Specifically, unhealthy alcohol use is common among persons living with HIV (PLWH) and increases the risk of developing negative outcomes. Antiretroviral therapy (ART) has shown increasing life expectancy and decreased HIV-related deaths, leading to a growing older adult HIV population. Yet, HIV accelerates the aging process and increases the risk for numerous chronic health conditions that compromise physical and mental health functioning and quality of life. Thus, PLWH continue to have shorter life expectancies relative to the general population and these multimorbidities explain this increased risk. In this context, unhealthy alcohol use among PLWH can further increase the risk for negative outcomes. Physical activity (PA) interventions can be used as an effective way to address unhealthy alcohol use among PLWH. Previous PA interventions have shown low generalizability and high loss to follow-up. Therefore, an intervention that is home-based, including lifestyle physical activity (LPA) with mobile health-delivered components is designed following the physical activity (PA) paradigm. Participants in this randomized controlled trial will be assigned to one of two study arms -- either the LPA or Fitbit Only intervention - both lasting 12-weeks. Both study arms will utilize a Fitbit to track daily step counts. In addition to utilizing a Fitbit, the LPA arm will receive 7 LPA sessions with a trained interventionist to assist in adding LPA to the participant's routine. The Fitbit only arm will receive only brief check-in phone calls and only related to assisting with any Fitbit functioning issues. Follow-up assessments will take place at 3 and 6 months."

Environmental factors, such as noise and light exposures contribute to the development of sleep disturbances in ICU. Hypnotics is the most prescribed treatment for managing ICU sleep; however, it only improves light sleep but not deep sleep, and could not deal with sleep disturbances caused by noise or light exposure. Purposes: To examine the effects of guided virtual reality autogenic meditation on sleep quality and quantity in critically ill adults as well as the possible mechanism through which they provide this alleviation. We hypothesize that critically ill adults undergoing guided virtual reality autogenic meditation (VR) will experience greater alleviations in sleep disturbances in comparison with participants in the eye masks and usual care control group (UC). Methods: The three-year, single-blinded randomized controlled trial will employ a three-arm parallel-group design. A total of 120 critical ill adults will be randomly allocated to the VR, Eye masks, or UC groups in a 1:1:1 ratio (40 participants in each group). For the VR group, all participants will experience 30-min, voice-guided autogenic meditation through head-mounted display device at 10 pm for 2 nights (ICU day 2 to day 4). For the Eye masks group, participants will wear eye mask from 10 pm to 7 am for 3 days. For the UC group, they will receive sleep promotion strategies, including reduced light exposure at night, decreased noise, and cluster nursing care during the study period. Primary outcomes are sleep parameters measured by the Chinese version of Richards-Campbell Sleep Questionnaire, Chinese version of Pittsburgh sleep quality index, and fitbit with one-lead electroencephalography sensor. Secondary outcomes consist of delirium, moods, and quality of life assessed using the Confusion Assessment Method for the Intensive Care Unit, visual analogue scale for anxiety, pain, stress, EuroQoL-5D, and cognitive function respectively. Measurement time points are the first day of ICU admission, pre-and post-treatment, and the day of 30 and 180 days after ICU discharge. A generalized estimating equation will be used to test research hypotheses."

            "Patients with digestive tract malignancy often experience severe and unremitting abdominal pain that negatively affects physical, emotional, and social function, as well as health related quality of life (HRQOL). Therapeutic virtual reality (VR) has emerged as a promising and evidence-based treatment modality for cancer pain. Users of VR wear a pair of goggles with a close-proximity screen in front of the eyes that creates a sensation of being transported into lifelike, three-dimensional worlds. To date, VR has been limited to short-term clinical trials for cancer pain. Moreover, limited research exists on theory-based VR modalities beyond mere distraction, such as VR that employs acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT) with components of biofeedback and mindfulness. To bridge these gaps, this study seeks to: (1) assess the impact of immersive VR on patient-reported outcomes (PROs), including pain, activity metrics, and opioid use among patients with visceral pain from a digestive tract malignancy; (2) assess differences in PROs, activity metrics, and opioid use between skills-based VR therapy vs. distraction VR therapy; and (3) determine patient-level predictors of VR treatment response in visceral cancer pain. To address these aims, the study will measure PROs and opioid use in 360 patients randomized among 3 groups and follow them for 60 days after enrollment: (1) an enhanced VR group receiving skills-based VR; (2) a distraction-based VR group receiving patient-selected VR videos; and (3) a VR sham control group using a VR headset with 2-D content. The results will inform best practices for the implementation of VR for visceral cancer pain management and guide selection of patient-tailored experiences."

Automated insulin delivery systems (AIDs) combine an insulin pump coupled via an algorithm with a continuous glucose monitor (CGM), allowing constant adjustment of insulin doses according to blood glucose levels. Despite the significant improvement in blood glucose parameters and quality of life with these systems, they are not available to everyone and more and more people with diabetes are resorting to home-made or do-it-yourself (DIY) systems to access this technology. DIY systems are not approved or regulated by Health Canada, despite the growing interest. There have been no studies looking at this type of system in active people living with DbT1, including the risk of exercise-induced hypoglycemia. The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of IDA systems in physically active individuals living with type 1 diabetes.This is a real-life observational study in people with commercial IDA (control group) and IDA-DIY. This study includes only one inclusion visit (which may be virtual) and the observation period is 6 weeks. Participants will be required to wear their own artificial pancreas system and give us access to blood glucose and insulin data at the end of the study.

However, results vary, potentially due to inconsistencies in how MABT components are utilized and emphasized. Optimizing MABTs using a typical approach, i.e., successive randomized controlled trials of various MABT packages, is slow and difficult. Multiphase Optimization Strategy (MOST) has been developed as a better method of optimizing treatment. Consistent with Phase I of MOST, we derived three MABT components from the theoretical literature. Evaluation of MABT components through a factorial design (MOST Phase II) will allow us to determine the independent and interacting efficacies of each MABT component, in addition to the identification of subsets of individuals most or least responsive to each component. Whereas mediational analyses have been inconclusive, the use of a factorial design will allow for a critical test of the main and interaction effects of individual MABT treatment components. The current study will use a full factorial design to identify the independent and combined effects of three core MABT components (Awareness, Acceptance, and Values Clarity) as additions to remotely delivered weight loss counseling. Moderators of treatment outcome (disinhibited eating, food cue susceptibility, emotional eating, delay discounting, and inhibitory control), and mediator/process variables implicated in MABTs (mindful eating, acceptance of food cues, mindfulness, body responsiveness, autonomous motivation, values clarity, hunger/satiety perceptions, and motivation and pleasure resulting from social functioning) will be assessed as well."

            "Repetitive pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is a noninvasive treatment that involves stimulating the brain; however, treatment benefit depends on placing a TMS coil in the correct place on the head to reach critical brain regions below. Clinicians typically use scalp-based targeting, a process in which rather than using MRI guidance to target brain regions for stimulation, they use landmarks on the scalp. Several researchers, including the investigators' lab, showed that the current scalp-based targeting techniques do not position stimulation above the correct brain region, and patients fail to respond. The investigators propose to improve clinical scalp-based targeting by comparing it to MRI guided targeting. The most common clinical population receiving rTMS therapy is depressed patients. The investigators' plan is to study the accuracy of certain scalp-based rules in patients with depression. Accurate brain stimulation targeting is critical for effective rTMS therapy. For participants who are not undergoing rTMS therapy who have COVID-19 distress, we are offering a combined home-based neuromodulation (transcranial electrical stimulation) and focused psychotherapy program dedicated to improving the same outcome measure, quality of life. Transcranial electrical stimulation (tES) stimulates the brain over a large region; however, we are able to model with brain imaging which brain regions receive the strongest stimulation. Our goal is still to examine stimulation precision, but we will test whether strength of tES in the same brain regions that rTMS is targeting will also lead to improved quality of life. We will also carefully assess whether it is possible to measure healthy functioning, an outcome in the rTMS study, because sheltering in place may reduce activities and thus distort our measure. We will also test whether our psychotherapy intervention will mitigate this effect and, if so, we may make it available to all those depressed Veterans in whom we're studying the effect of neuromodulation on functioning."

            "Loss of independence, cognitive decline, and difficulties in everyday function are areas of great concern for older adults and their families. From a public health perspective, successful efforts that enable older adults to age within their homes, as compared to nursing homes, will save an estimated $80 billion dollars per year. Cognitive training is one intervention that maintains cognition, everyday function, and health. Although clearly an important and effective intervention, the mediators, or mechanisms, underlying this program are unknown. Our overall objective is to assess the cognitive and psychosocial factors within daily life that account for the transfer of one form of cognitive training to everyday function. This exploratory double-blind trial will randomize older adults to 20 hours of cognitive training or cognitively stimulating activities. The investigators will assess cognitive and psychosocial factors before, during, and after training within daily life. The investigators will then compare such factors and assess how they impact the transfer of cognitive training to everyday functioning. The investigators will also include an eligible sub group of the EFIT participants who will have functional MRI brain scans and sleep evaluation using the Sleep Profiler, a clinically approved device, at pre and post brain training. The investigators will also monitor daily activity in this sub group using FitBIt watches. Our central hypothesis is that improvements in daily processing speed and attention, key components of higher order cognitive functions, will have the strongest relationship with everyday function changes. This exploratory study is the first of its kind and will be used to provide important data relevant to a future larger randomized controlled trial examining mediators of cognitive training in a representative sample of adults. Additionally, all data collection, with the exception of MRI, can be completed remotely within the participant's home. This information will assist in the future development of more effective home- and community-based interventions that maintain everyday function."

            "Studies evaluating lifestyle intervention in obese women during pregnancy have reported limited success in decreasing excessive gestational weight gain, and have failed to achieve the key outcome of breaking the obesity cycle and reducing neonatal adiposity or birth weight. Although some investigators advocate weight loss during pregnancy in obese women, these recommendations were based on extrapolation of retrospective epidemiological data. Of concern, we reported increased small for gestational age babies and decreased lean body mass in neonates of obese women with weight loss or inadequate gestational weight gain. Based on our research, optimal outcomes from lifestyle interventions are likely to be temporal and therefore must be initiated prior to conception to first improve maternal metabolic function, and subsequently, placental/fetal growth. Several large retrospective cohort studies support our hypothesis. For example, women who lost weight between pregnancies had fewer large for gestational age babies in contrast to women who increased interpregnancy weight. In addition, prospective randomized controlled trials have shown that postpartum weight loss is achievable without adverse maternal or neonatal outcomes, these studies include women who breastfed. Based on these observations, we propose a randomized control trial to determine the effect of lifestyle intervention initiated prior to a planned pregnancy on improving neonatal metabolism and adiposity. Our overarching hypothesis is that the maternal pre-pregnancy metabolic condition determines the obesogenic in-utero environment, which affects programming of placental mitochondrial function and metabolic pathways, promoting lipid accumulation and neonatal adiposity. Our rationale is based on the need to establish the most effective time to introduce an intervention that will break the obesity cycle in mothers and their children. Understanding how pregravid metabolic conditioning improves maternal physiology, and cellular and molecular function in pregnancy will provide the empirical data to support the intervention. We have a highly successful record of recruiting women who are planning a pregnancy, obtaining compliance in longitudinal studies, and in long-term follow-up of mothers and their offspring. Lifestyle intervention will be initiated prior to conception to decrease maternal body fat, inflammation, insulin resistance, and ?-cell dysfunction. Our transdisciplinary team has the required expertise in lifestyle interventions management of obesity, and in human physiology that is needed to determine the effects of these interventions on maternal metabolism and fetalplacental growth and function. We will recruit 200 women to pursue the following specific aims: Specific Aim 1: To investigate the physiological significance of lifestyle intervention in preparation for pregnancy (LIPP) on maternal and neonatal metabolism and adiposity. Specific Aim 2: To determine the molecular effects whereby lifestyle intervention initiated before pregnancy can improve placental mitochondrial lipid oxidation and accumulation."

The ACEs Aware Initiative recognizes nature experiences as one of seven \"stress busters.\" Indeed, California boasts many outdoor resources for clinicians to integrate into the network of care. Through a calming effect on the autonomic nervous system, providing a setting for supportive relationships to develop and physical activity to occur, time in nature may help California prevent, heal and treat ACEs and the clinical sequelae.

However, women live with physical and emotional side effects secondary to treatment for years after cancer treatments have ended. Exercise can help to manage these side effects, however, less than 30% of this population takes part in regular exercise. The objective of this trial is to determine the feasibility and effectiveness of a novel exercise and education program for women with breast cancer during chemotherapy. METHODS: Participants in this study include women with a diagnosis of stage 1 - 3 breast cancer undergoing chemotherapy. Women will be divided into three groups. The first group will include 8 sessions of exercise and self-management education during their chemotherapy treatment. The second group will receive self-management education only, and the third group will receive usual care. Outcomes will be compared between groups at baseline, post-intervention, and at 6- and 12- month follow up. Outcomes to be assessed include exercise level, functional mobility, muscle strength, quality of life, health status, and use of health care services. EXPECTED OUTCOMES: Women with breast cancer are among the least active segment of the Canadian population. It is well known that inactivity can lead to physical and psychological side effects, cancer recurrence, and an increase in comorbid conditions. This proposed project addresses a long-standing need to help women with breast cancer become and stay more active by implementing a novel exercise and education program."

            "GERD affects roughly 20% of the U.S. population and the direct and indirect costs of GERD are substantial, totaling close to 50 billion dollars per year. Evidence supports that a large proportion of this cost and poor clinical outcomes in GERD are related to poor healthcare decisions by both the physician and the patient. The problem of inappropriate GERD management stems from three main issues. First, the disease is heterogeneous and requires treatment informed by a precision model. Second, the current paradigm largely ignores the important brain-gut interactions that drive symptoms and healthcare utilization. Third, there is a paucity of well-performed comparative effectiveness trials focused on assessing treatments beyond acid suppression. We will use physiomarkers defined during the previous funding cycle to phenotype the patients and use cognitive behavioral interventions to modulate hypervigilance to test the Psycho-Physiologic Model of GERD. Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) is able to improve hypervigilance and symptom specific autonomic arousal and thus, we will test our theory that CBT can improve outcomes in GERD by targeting these two important psychologic stressors. We will also continue our focus on the interplay of psychology and physiology by determining whether increased mucosal permeability is associated with reflux perception and whether this is modified by hypervigilance and autonomic disruption."

Cervical cancer patients report higher levels of psychological distress compared to other (gynecological) cancer types, resulting in physical and psychosocial limitations. The mechanisms explaining why some patients do, and others do not experience persistent psychological distress after cervical cancer remain unclear. Objective: Gain insight into the mechanisms explaining psychological distress (i.e. anxiety, depression, cancer worry, perceived stress) in a prospective population-based sample of cervical cancer patients. Factors to be studied include characteristics of the individual (demographical and clinical, including comorbidities), characteristics of the environment ((sexual) relationships), biological function (cortisol, melatonin and sex hormone production assessed in scalp hair, inflammation and telomere length assessed in blood, overall quality of life (EORTC QLQ-C30), symptoms (EORTC QLQ-CX24), functional status (physical activity and sleep measured using the Actigraph activity tracker, and food intake measured using the online 'Eetmeter'), and general health perceptions (B-IPQ).

Serial blood samples will be collected before and 3, 6 and 12 months after catheter ablation to calculate the ABC scores as well as the traditional bleeding and stroke risks. Following catheter ablation, continuous rhythm monitoring will be achieved using an insertable monitor or an implanted atrial lead of a cardiac implantable electronic device. Additionally, heart rate monitoring via photoplethysmography using a smartwatch and/or smartphone is performed for a period of six months. Data are analyzed for differences in ABC scores before and after ablation in relation to possible AF/AT recurrences. Furthermore, we are going to compare the sensitivity and specificity of different follow-up modalities post ablation.

Additionally, CBD may cause alterations in aspects of health and fitness, fatigue, stress, calmness, quality of life, cognitive function, ability to maintain focus, sleep quantity, and sleep quality. Cannabidiol may be associated with alterations in inflammatory response in the human body, which has implications in both healthy and diseased populations. Natural killers cells (NKC) play a vital role in maintain your body's defenses and are an essential component of your immune system. In humans, NKC contain the highest concentrations of receptors associated with the endocannabinoid system and CBD. Human models have demonstrated that CBD use increases the percentage of NKC in peripheral blood. However, similar models found that CBD administration inhibits markers of NKC cytotoxic function, a beneficial cellular mechanism used to prevent malignant cell transformation and viral infection. The overarching goal of this investigation is to determine the effects of an 8-week CBD intervention on measures of fatigue, stress, calmness, quality of life, cognitive function, focus, health and fitness, and sleep quantity, and sleep quality.

The best proof of NACT efficacy is pathological complete response (pCR), i.e. the absence of invasive tumour on post-NACT surgical histopathology. While it is known that physical exercise can help patients to better tolerate and complete often harsh cancer treatments, it is an emerging area of research to understand if and how exercise exerts anti-tumour effects and improves oncological outcomes. The main aim of the Neo-ACT trial is to examine if a physical exercise intervention during NACT can increase pCR rates in breast cancer. Secondary aims are residual cancer burden, radiological tumour response, patient-related outcomes (health-related quality of life, physical activity), physiological outcomes (muscle strength, cardiorespiratory fitness), cancer treatment-related toxicities (cognitive dysfunction, chemotherapy completion rates) and long-term sick leave. Furthermore, the trial will explore how physical exercise affects anti-tumoral mechanisms inherent to therapy or host by hypothesis-generating translational analyses. 712 patients with primary invasive breast cancer will be randomized to either a supervised intervention of high-intensity interval and resistance training during NACT, supported by an exercise app, or to usual care, and followed for two years. Physical activity is meticulously tracked. By offering patients active involvement, the trial contributes strongly to the concept of personalized medicine."

In a landmark Finnish Geriatric Intervention Study to Prevent Cognitive Impairment and Disability (FINGER), a multimodal lifestyle programme had clear benefits on older adults' cognition, functioning, and quality of life. The LETHE study utilises novel technologies and digital tools to deliver an optimised and more personalised FINGER-type multimodal lifestyle intervention. A total of 160 digitally skilled older adults (age 60-77) with risk factors for dementia but without substantial cognitive impairment will be recruited in Austria, Finland, Italy, and Sweden. Participants will be randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to the structured ICT-assisted multimodal lifestyle program (intervention group) or a self-guided lifestyle program (control group). Duration of the study and the intervention is 24 months. The multimodal lifestyle program covers the following domains: physical activity, nutrition, cognitive activity, vascular risk management, social interaction, sleep, and relaxation. The structured intervention program follows a hybrid model where regular in-person, individual and group-based intervention activities led by professionals are supported with activities in the LETHE mobile phone application. The self-guided (control) group receives relevant health advice and is recommended and encouraged to independently implement healthy lifestyle changes that are suitable and fit in with their daily routine. Control group will have access to a simplified version of the LETHE app without any structured, scheduled activities or personalized content. The primary objective of the LETHE trial is to test the feasibility of a digitally supported multimodal lifestyle program (i.e., retention rate, adherence to intervention), and assess change in dementia risk based on validated risk scores (CAIDE, LIBRA). Other objectives include testing the intervention effects on lifestyle and risk factors, cognition, function, health-related quality of life, health literacy, physical functioning, and dementia-related biomarkers.

            "Sedentary behaviour has a detrimental effect on the mortality, morbidity, and well-being of patients with type 2 diabetes and prediabetes, and general practitioners should advise patients on how to self-monitor and increase their physical activity. The emergence of mobile health (mHealth) technologies unlocks the potential to further improve physical behaviour using an innovative \"just-in-time\" adaptive approach whereby behavioural support is provided in real-time, based on data from wearable sensors. Thus, the investigators aim to evaluate the effect of a just-in-time mHealth intervention administered by general practitioners on the physical activity and sedentary behaviour of patients with type 2 diabetes and prediabetes. A total of 340 patients will be recruited from 20 general practices across the Czech Republic and randomly assigned to either an active control or intervention group. Both groups will receive brief physical activity advice from their general practitioners and a Fitbit fitness tracker to self-monitor their daily steps, but the intervention group will also receive a mHealth-enabled just-in-time adaptive intervention and regular monthly phone counselling in the first 6 months. The mHealth intervention will be delivered using a custom-developed system (HealthReact) connected to the Fitbit that will trigger just-in-time text messages. For example, a prompt to take a break from sedentary behaviour will be triggered after 30 sedentary minutes or a motivational message with a specific goal to take more steps will be triggered when the total step count is too low. The primary outcome will be the change in daily step count at 6 months, other outcomes include changes in other physical behaviour measures, blood tests, anthropometry and patient-reported outcomes at 6 and 12 months. If the intervention is effective, this study will provide a model of health prevention that can be directly implemented and commissioned within primary care using existing infrastructure."

            "Regular physical activity (PA) is essential to healthy aging. Unfortunately, only 5% of US adults meet guideline of 150 minutes of moderate exercise; Veterans and non-Veterans have similar levels of PA. A patient incentive program for PA may help. Behavioral economics suggests that the chronic inability to start and maintain a PA routine may be the result of \"present bias,\" which is a tendency to value immediate rewards over rewards in the future. With present bias, it is always better to exercise tomorrow because the immediate gratification of watching television or surfing the internet is a more powerful motivator than the intangible and delayed benefit of future health. Patient incentives may overcome present bias by moving the rewards for exercise forward in time. Recent randomized trials suggest that incentives for PA can be effective, but substantial gaps in knowledge prevent the implementation of a PA incentive program in Veterans Affairs (VA). First, incentive designs vary considerably. They vary by the size of the incentive, the type of incentive (cash or non-financial), the probability of earning an incentive (an assured payment for effort or a lottery-based incentive), or whether the incentive is earned after the effort is given (a gain-framed incentive) or awarded up-front and lost if the effort is not given (a loss-framed incentive). The optimal combination of these components for a Veteran population is unknown. Second, the evidence about the effective components of incentives comes from studies conducted in populations that were overwhelmingly female; often employees at large companies, with high levels of education and income. VA users, in contrast, are mostly male and lower income, and most are not employed. This is important because the investigators have theoretical reasons to believe that the effects of components of incentives are likely to vary by income and gender. Finally, few studies have managed to design an incentive such that the physical activity was maintained after the incentive was removed. Indeed, a common theme in incentivizing health behavior change is the difficulty in sustaining behavior change once the incentives are removed."

Interdisciplinary Pain Rehabilitation Programs (IPRPs), a subset of Interdisciplinary Treatment (IDT) includes physical activity and exercise and is considered superior to single-treatment measures in patients with chronic pain. However, effects emerge sub-optimal and as many as 30% of patients deteriorate in some outcomes. A novel intervention, eVISualisation (eVIS) of physical activity and pain, has been systematically developed to facilitate patients in reaching and maintaining recommended individualized physical activity levels. The aim is to transparently report on methodology, outcome assessments, and processes for a registry-based randomized controlled trial (R-RCT) initiated as an internal pilot study. Methods and analysis: The R-RCT will recruit approximately 400 patients with chronic pain who are registered at primary and specialized IPRP units (n=15) in Sweden. Participants will be randomly allocated to either an IPRP + eVIS or the control group that will receive only IPRP treatment. eVIS entails objectively measured physical activity (steps) and patient-reported outcomes (pain intensity, affect on daily activities, pharmaceutical consumption) collected and visualized in the web application PATRON. Data from an initial 30 participants completing the study period (6 months) will be included in a pilot study designed to evaluate recruitment- and randomization processes, standardized effect size, sample size, characteristics of outcomes, follow-up rates of the R-RCT. Outcome variables will be extracted from PATRON and from six national registries. Multivariate statistics and repeated measures analyses will be performed. Quality Adjusted Life Years (QALYs) and Incremental Cost Effectiveness Ratio (ICER) will be calculated for cost effectiveness evaluation. Ethics/dissemination: The Swedish Ethics Review Board granted approval (Dnr 2021/02109). Results will be disseminated through peer-review journals."

            "The VFB Ecosystem capitalizes on digital technologies' ability to connect parents and children, allowing parents to actively support their child's physical activity, even when parents cannot be present. The VFB is a kiosk-based system that houses a virtual dog programmed to allow children to set self-determined physical activity goals. The children wear Fitbits while performing physical activity. Using the unique data embedded in the Fitbit, the kiosk is able to detect each individual child and automatically connect him or her to a unique, personalized virtual dog. Physical activity data is transmitted automatically from the Fitbit to the kiosk when the child approaches, and the virtual dog provides accurate evaluations of whether the child met the self-determined physical activity goal, offering words of encouragement and physical activity support. The virtual pet functions as a personalized fitness buddy to encourage children to set and meet physical activity goals, promote physical activity self-efficacy, and foster mutually supportive relationships among children, parents, and the virtual pet. This will be particularly helpful for children who receive insufficient amounts of social support in their current environment. Concurrently, the kiosk sends a text message to parents on the child's physical activity progress. Parents are then able to send words of encouragement and communicate with their children via the kiosk, using the text messaging feature of their mobile phones. Thus, even when the parent is not with the child, the virtual pet is designed to serve as a coordinating focus for facilitating parent-child communication. Parents will also receive text messages from the kiosk with a security code to access a website that provides detailed records of the child's physical activity over time."

            "Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a chronic lung disease primarily caused by smoking. Pulmonary rehabilitation (PR) is an evidence-based, interdisciplinary, and comprehensive intervention for COPD patients that includes patient assessment, exercise training, and self-management education to promote behavior changes. PR has been shown to be the most effective strategy to improve clinical health outcomes, and is now considered to be a standard of care intervention for individuals with COPD who remain symptomatic despite optimal drug therapies. Despite considerable evidence supporting the effectiveness of PR at enhancing clinical outcomes, it is unclear if PR influences the behaviors that promote COPD management (i.e., physical activity, medication adherence, self-managing exacerbations). In collaboration with the local clinical staff as well as national colleagues and the Canadian Thoracic Society, a new national pulmonary rehabilitation program has been co-developed that is designed to increase physical activity, medication adherence, and skills to help manage chronic lung diseases. The new program aims to increase people's confidence and autonomy for performing disease-management behaviors, and has been designed to be more effective at increasing physical activity, medication adherence, and disease management skills than previous pulmonary rehabilitation programs. The program is designed to be delivered within different settings of practice, including traditional PR centers, satellite sites (i.e., sites that are remote from the major institutions),with the use of Tele-health and web-based resources, and primary care medical centers. The effectiveness of the new Standardized Canadian PR program will be assessed relative to the traditional PR program. This trial is an important step towards establishing the necessary evidence that will then enable us to work on dissemination and implementation of this new standardized PR program across the country."

            "Impact of Metabolic Health Patterns And Breast Cancer Over Time in Women",
            "Background & Rationale: Breast cancer (BC) is the most commonly diagnosed malignancy in women worldwide (2.1 million diagnoses in 2018, 25% of new cancer cases). In Canada, early stage BC mortality rates have decreased by 48% over the past 30 years as a result of advances in prevention, detection, and treatment. However, competing risks for mortality from non-cancer causes have emerged, where cardiovascular disease (CVD) is now a leading cause of death for BC survivors. The direct toxic effects of BC treatment on the heart (cardiotoxicity) are well characterized by the investigators and many others, as a contributor to elevated cardiovascular risk. However, BC treatment and the associated lifestyle changes (i.e. physical inactivity, poor diet quality, stress) are increasingly recognized to also strongly affect metabolism negatively manifesting as insulin resistance, dyslipidemia and adipose tissue (fat) accumulation. These adverse metabolic changes are strongly linked to CVD risk and represent a currently underappreciated contributor to the elevated CVD risk among BC survivors. Preliminary data and recent publications demonstrate that regional fat accumulation occurs during BC treatment and that the fat burden in key locations is associated with poor cardiorespiratory health. A trigger of these adverse metabolic and inflammatory effects is excess fat specifically within ectopic fat (viscera, intermuscular, or hepatic) regions. In 2019, a member of the study team found that the volume of visceral and intermuscular but not subcutaneous fat at BC diagnosis were linearly associated with CVD events within 6 years, even among those with normal BMI and after adjustment for pre-existing CVD risk factors and for BC treatment type. Using MRI, investigators found that ~1 year after chemotherapy, BC survivors had significantly larger depots of visceral fat (49% larger) and thigh intermuscular fat (41% larger) compared to age and sex-matched controls, despite similar BMI and subcutaneous fat volumes in the two groups. Investigators also showed that the fat fraction within the thigh muscle and visceral fat volumes independently explained ~50% of the variation in cardiorespiratory fitness (measured by peak VO2). In particular, peak VO2 is one of the most powerful predictors of all-cause and CVD mortality and health care costs, and is the most consistently reported negative sequelae after treatment for BC. Unfortunately, there are no known therapies to recover long-term myocardial damage (i.e. cell death, fibrosis) from cancer therapies. There are several reasons to target fat as a therapeutic target in BC patients: 1) The study team have compelling preliminary data showing accelerated formation of ectopic fat during BC treatment. 2) Investigator's recent data showed that high fat content in key fat pools was associated with reduced peak VO2. 3) The burden of fat and the associated metabolic abnormalities are dynamic and malleable, and thus highly treatable. Research Question & Objectives: The primary purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of a behavioural intervention involving supported time-restricted eating (TRE), diet quality improvements, and reduced sedentary time versus usual cancer and nutrition care in BC patients receiving chemotherapy treatment on ectopic fat, cardiometabolic profile, and chemotherapy outcomes. The investigators hypothesize that the intervention will attenuate the growth of ectopic fat during chemotherapy and reduce chemotherapy symptoms."

            "Older patients with end- stage kidney disease (ESKD) are at very high risk for functional impairment. Kidney transplantation (KT) has the potential to ameliorate the detrimental effects of ESKD on physical activity and functional status. However, KT alone may not meet the full extent of this potential, particularly for older or more impaired adults. In fact, activity declines immediately post-KT and fails to return to expected levels even 5 years post-KT. Older patients waitlisted for KT (most of whom are on dialysis) are therefore reliant on their pre-KT levels of exercise, which are also predictive of post-KT mortality. \"Prehabilitation\" has been used in other surgical populations to minimize functional loss, and a structured exercise program may be beneficial in the pre- KT setting. However, few waitlisted patients are able to participate in typical exercise interventions due to barriers such as severe fatigue. Older patients have additional barriers such as further mobility impairment and requiring substantial caregiver support. Therefore for older living donor kidney transplant candidates, it is necessary to address issues such as specifics of coaching, timing, and importantly, incorporate caregiver participation. The overall objective of this proposal is to adapt a previously developed 8- week, home- based, structured exercise program among older (\u226550 years) dialysis patients awaiting living donor KT, with a focus on caregiver involvement. The investigators will trial the exercise program as compared to usual care. The investigators will then pilot the refined intervention in a total of 72 patient-caregiver dyads, 48 of whom will undergo the proposed intervention (24 with caregiver participation, 24 without). The primary outcomes for the pilot will be change in physical performance and activity from baseline to after the intervention, along with measurements of exploratory quality of life outcomes. In addition, the investigators will measure these same outcomes at 3- months post KT to evaluate for a durable effect of the intervention. An additional post-transplantation outcome of interest will be number of days hospitalized within 3 months of transplantation."

Physical activity (PA) is the second largest predictor of stroke and the cornerstone of secondary prevention therapies. Adaptive interventions involve sequential treatments responsive to individuals' performance. Despite guidelines to adapt PA to individuals' needs, there is no evidence on the empirical development of adaptive PA interventions post-stroke. The evidence is dominated by standard trial designs, used to evaluate non-adaptive PA interventions. This trial will make original contributions to the literature by designing a first-in-class adaptive PA intervention using an innovative experimental design. This design will permit the delivery of optimal sequences of treatments to increase PA for individuals. Furthermore, by developing a user-informed smartphone application, this feasibility trial will lead to the design and evaluation of a highly-scalable definitive intervention to reduce the risk of recurrent stroke. Aim To use a Sequential Multiple-Assignment Randomised Trial (SMART) design to develop an adaptive, user-informed mobile health (mHealth) intervention to improve PA post-stroke. Subsequently this adaptive intervention will be evaluated against a treatment-as-usual control using a standard trial design in a definitive trial. Methods A co-design process was used to develop the technology platform for intervention delivery. There are two components which target increased PA in the current intervention: Structured Exercise and Lifestyle PA. The SMART will determine what sequence and/or combination of these intervention components produces the greatest increase in physical activity as measured by average daily step count. The primary outcome will be PA (steps/day), with clear feasibility and secondary clinical and cost outcomes.

So far, research has not shown whether CR helps improve the abnormal heart rhythms seen in AF. This may be because CR programs usually do not offer specific help with weight management. Therefore, adding behavioural weight-loss treatment (BWLT; group classes to change thoughts and behaviours to encourage weight loss) to CR programs may help people with AF and obesity experience relief from their symptoms. This randomized controlled trial will assess whether the combination of an AF-specific 'small changes' BWLT and traditional CR results in a greater proportion of patients with AF and obesity achieving \u2265 10% body weight loss compared to patients who receive standard care (traditional CR alone). Traditional CR consists of participating in exercise sessions, supervised by health professionals, twice per week for 12 weeks. In addition to traditional CR, patients that are randomized to receive BWLT will attend 12 weekly online group therapy classes to learn strategies from psychology to help encourage weight loss. The investigators will collect data pertaining to weight, AF burden, physical activity, and disease-specific and generic patient-reported outcomes. This information will determine if taking CR+BWLT helps patients with weight loss and AF symptoms. Further, it will help efforts to provide effective treatment to patients with AF to help participants lose weight and reduce or eliminate AF symptoms."

Evidence suggests great health benefits can be achieved for older adults who are the most sedentary, and that replacing sitting with even light intensity walking can be beneficial. The overarching goal of the project is to develop an inexpensive and scalable tool to increase volume of physical activity in our target population, older adults living in a residential facility. MapTrek is a web-based application that allows participants to take a virtual walk in interesting locations around the world while tracking their progress against the progress of other older adults living in a retirement community.

While disease manifestations may vary amongst the spectrum of MPNs, quality of life considerations including fatigue, concentration difficulties, pain, sleep disturbance, and depression are negatively affected in most MPN patients. Inflammation has been suggested to be involved in the development of disease-related symptoms. Specific pro-inflammatory cytokines (e.g., IL-1, IL-6, IL-8, and TNF-\u03b1) have been associated with particular patient-reported symptoms, including fatigue, abdominal complaints, microvascular symptoms, and constitutional symptoms. Pharmacologic therapy can positively impact MPN related symptoms, specifically with JAK inhibition, however, these treatments often come with negative side effects (e.g., anemia, thrombocytopenia). Much opportunity remains for improving MPN symptoms (i.e., fatigue, insomnia, loss of muscle mass, and debilitation) and quality of life. Yoga, a gentle form of meditative exercise, has been shown to improve symptom management and quality of life parameters in cancer patients and may be effective in improving MPN-related symptoms. Here we propose a study evaluating the efficacy of an online yoga intervention comparing a yoga group to a wait-list control group for improving symptom burden and quality of life in MPN patients. Secondarily, we plan to evaluate the feasibility of collecting potential biomarkers that are related to MPN disease-related activity, such as fatigue (i.e., cortisol and serum cytokines)."

Interventions to promote physical activity and sleep that use commercial activity trackers may be useful non-pharmacological approaches to managing individual health; however, limited evidence exists on their use to improve physical activity in elderly patients with multimorbidity. This study aims to measure the effects of behavioral change techniques (BCTs) delivered by a wearable device on physical activity (PA) and quality of sleep (QS) in elderly patients with multimorbidity. The investigators designed an open-label randomized controlled trial with participants recruited through primary care and a specialist outpatient clinic. Participants must be more than 65 years old, have multimorbidity, and have access to smartphones. All eligible participants will receive PA promotion content and will be randomly assigned to wear a smartwatch. The primary outcome will be the participants' PA measurement at six months using the IPAQ-SF.

However, evidence suggests that physical activity remains unchanged after TKR. This randomized clinical trial is investigating the efficacy, fidelity, and safety of a physical therapist administered physical activity intervention for people after TKR. Methods/Design: One hundred and twenty-five individuals, over the age of 45, who seek outpatient Physical Therapy (PT) following a unilateral TKR will be randomized into a control and intervention group. The intervention group will receive a weekly physical activity intervention during PT, which includes a FitbitTM monitor, individualized step goals, and face-to-face feedback provided by the physical therapist. Efficacy of the intervention will be measured by minutes/week spent in Moderate-to-Vigorous Physical Activity (MPVA) using an Actigraph GT3X monitor from enrollment to discharge, 6 months and 12 months from discharge from PT. The association of self-efficacy for exercise and kinesiophobia with physical activity will also be measured at the same time points. Fidelity and safety of the intervention will be assessed during outpatient PT. Discussion: This study is designed to fill a critical clinical need to increase physical activity after TKR. The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the efficacy of a physical therapist administered physical activity intervention for people after TKR. The secondary objectives are to evaluate the fidelity and safety of a physical therapist administered physical activity intervention for people after TKR and to investigate changes in self-reported and performance-based physical function after a physical therapist administered physical activity intervention for people after TKR.

There are significant concerns that a cohort of children may be at-risk for mental illness and impaired self-regulation due to elevated exposure to perinatal maternal mental illness. Intervention is crucial as the intergenerational effects of maternal mental illness are most pronounced when mental health concerns persist. There is currently an urgent need for accessible eHealth interventions for mothers of young children as the pandemic has contributed to an increased prevalence of mental health concerns and to additional barriers to services. The Building Emotion Awareness and Mental Health (BEAM) app-based program was developed to help address maternal mental health concerns and parenting stress. A two-arm randomized controlled trial (RCT) with repeated measures will be used to evaluate the efficacy of the BEAM intervention compared to treatment as usual (TAU) among a sample of 140 mothers who self-report moderate-to-severe symptoms of depression and/or anxiety and have a child 18 to 36 months-old."

This approach is limited because some people either do not need to lose weight, do not want to lose weight, cannot lose weight, or cannot maintain weight loss over a lifetime. This study proposes to evaluate the effectiveness of a lifestyle modification that focuses on reducing post-meal blood glucose (BG) elevations instead of weight loss. It works by teaching participants to: 1) choose low glycemic load foods that do not significantly increase their blood glucose, and 2) increase their routine physical activity after meals when it can offset post-meal blood glucose elevations. The study will also evaluate the role feedback about blood glucose fluctuations can play in improving the effectiveness of this program."

            "Individuals with mild cognitive impairment are often physically inactive and at risk for progressing to dementia. Physical inactivity is considered a modifiable risk factor for dementia. Therefore, interventions must be developed to foster sustainable improvement in daily physical activity. To address this problem, our pilot study aims are directed at assessing the feasibility and preliminary improvement of physical activity following the use of a mobile-health technology physical activity behavior change intervention. Similar interventions have shown to be very effective in older adults without cognitive impairment. We specifically focus on the subtype of amnestic mild cognitive impairment since this subtype often progresses to Alzheimer's Disease, a leading cause of death in the US. Improving physical activity is one approach to reduce the progression to Alzheimer's Disease and subsequently lower mortality. To increase the impact of the intervention, participants with amnestic mild cognitive impairment will be recruited along with a primary caregiver (dyads). Thirty dyads will be recruited and randomized to either an intervention group (15 dyads) or usual care group (15 dyads). The intervention group will receive a 12-week mobile-health technology physical activity behavior change intervention structured to improve physical activity. The intervention is unique in the combination of established behavior change theories and techniques and remote delivery for individuals with amnestic mild cognitive impairment. This pilot study is designed to assess the feasibility of the intervention by examining participant and primary caregiver retention, intervention session attendance, intervention acceptability and safety, and qualitative perspectives. Secondly, this pilot study will assess preliminary improvement in physical activity (i.e., daily steps). Improvement will be determined based on significant changes in participants' daily steps observed via accelerometry post-intervention in the intervention group compared to the usual care control group. The results of this study will support future work (K-award and R01 submissions) to explore efficacy and larger-scale implementation to reach rural and underserved areas of Nebraska and beyond."

Although reasons for this include reduced physical activity owing to unfixed working hours, lack of sleep or disturbances in the circadian rhythm may also be related to the occurrences of type 2 diabetes or metabolic syndrome. The mechanism may be due to sleep deprivation induced activation of the hypothalamic- pituitary- adrenal axis (HPA axis) that affects blood glucose metabolism. The gut brain axis might adjust the HPA axis via the bottom-up pathway through vagus nerve, the neuroendocrine system, or the immune system. It is also possible that physiological or psychological stressors might influence intestinal function through the top-down pathways. Associations between microbiota and many chronic diseases, including metabolic syndrome, diabetes, obesity, neurodegenerative diseases, or mental diseases have been investigated in recent years. However, the application of using probiotics in treating sleep disorders is still lacking. The probiotics used in this proposal are selected to be more related to mental conditions. The PS128, which belongs to Lactobacillus plantarum subsp. plantarum and PS23 belongs to Lactobacillus paracasei group. Both PS128 and PS23 probiotic capsules contain 10 billion CFU (colony forming units) of PS128 or PS23. The PS23 heat-treated probiotic capsule contain 10 billion PS23 cells.

Therefore this open-label designed, single arm, baseline-controlled trial aiming to examine whether an 8-week intervention of a novel psychobiotic Lactobacillus plantarum PS128TM (PS128TM), may improve self-perceived stress and mood symptoms among high-stress IT specialists."

Light-intensity physical activity (LiPA) such as walking slowly, household activities or taking a flight of stairs might be a potential target for lowering the CVD risk in patients with T2D since it can perhaps be more be incorporated into daily life. To assess cardiovascular disease risk in this single-blinded RCT, the investigators settled on measuring arterial stiffness as the primary outcome. Arterial stiffness has independent predictive value for cardiovascular events and can be measured reliably and non-invasively. The investigators hypothesize that light intensity physical activity intervention program based upon increasing LiPA by replacing sedentary time is effective in lowering arterial stiffness as estimated by aortic pulse wave velocity (PWV) and carotid distensibility in individuals with T2D."

The objective of this project is to develop personalized dynamical models of physical activity (PA) under different weather and temporal conditions as well as in response to different types of intervention messages. This approach relies on having extensive observations within the person under varying conditions to develop a dynamical model of how different conditions interact with each other to predict how behavior changes in response to text messages. Complementary sub-models will be estimated for each participant to describe their behavioral responses under different weather conditions. Healthy but insufficiently active young adults (n=80) will wear an activity monitor and receive a variety of randomly-timed and randomly-selected notifications via smartphone. GPS coordinates at the time of messages delivery and receipt are recorded and used to look up weather indices at that location at that time. The work is exploratory/descriptive as we will be developing models to describe participants' responses to messages under different weather conditions. This work is needed to develop the decision rules for a subsequent behavioral intervention that will be developed and tested in a future project."

In Canada, there has been tremendous success for survivorship programs for breast, prostate, and colorectal cancer, however lung cancer survivorship programs have not been widely developed. The complexity of the disease, high mortality, short survival times, high cost of surveillance, and patient habits have traditionally been barriers against the success of lung cancer survivorship programs. The investigator proposes a feasibility study to pilot a novel intervention titled Breathe Anew, which will aim to identify and overcome the barriers to the design and implementation of a lung cancer survivorship program. The investigator has assembled a multi-disciplinary team of experts and lung cancer survivors who will develop the Breathe Anew survivorship intervention. The intervention will be vetted using an integrated knowledge translation approach, which will involve members of the target population, primarily patients who previously underwent lung resection, to modify the intervention and ensure acceptability. After Breathe Anew has been designed, it will be tested in a pilot study of 50 patients to ensure its feasibility and determine its cost. The ultimate goal of this feasibility study is to lay the groundwork for a subsequent comparative trial to evaluate the impact of Breathe Anew on patient-important outcomes including health related quality and length of life and postoperative complications."

Despite the positive outcomes associated with vital sign monitoring (i.e., increased survival-to-discharge rates, lower complication rates and shorter length of stay in hospital), the prohibitive costs of conventional patient monitors and the difficulty in maintaining complex medical equipment limit its practice in the developing world. Currently, due to lack of medical supplies, most ANC clinics - within the health facilities or during outreach activities - do not monitor for vital signs and blood pressure among pregnant women. While many devices exist, their ease of use and high-cost, including maintenance costs, hinder screening and monitoring programs in low resource settings. Accurate and low-cost vital sign monitoring devices are required to improve identification and treatment of women with danger signs during their routine ANC visits. To meet the growing demand for vital sign monitors during the COVID-19 pandemic, Neopenda has adapted an affordable, wearable, wireless vital sign monitoring solution (neoSpotTM), that measures temperature, respiration rate, blood oxygen saturation, pulse rate, and blood pressure."

The HR is an important measure to determine the recommended exercise training intensity and to monitor the training intensity in patients with cardiac diseases. The target exercise training intensity during cardiac rehabilitation is between 40% to 70% of heart rate reserve (HRR). Also, cardiac patients who have hypoxemia are advised to continuously monitor their Spo2. Therefore, this study aims to investigate the accuracy of the Apple Watch in measuring the HR and Spo2 in Saudi patients with cardiac diseases. Method: A cross sectional study will be invited one-hundred cardiac patients will be invited and recruited to participate in this study and the eligible participants will be randomly allocated into two groups. The first group (Group-A) will include the cardiac patients with regular HR and the second group (Group-B) will include the cardiac patients with irregular HR. Both groups will use the apple watch to evaluate the HR and the Spo2 against the Polar HR monitor and pulse oximeter at rest, during, and after the mild to moderate intensity exercise training session (40% to 70% HRR). The HR and the Spo2 monitoring, and recording will run on a 30 second schedule at rest (pre-session; for 3-minutes), during the 15-minutes session and over 5-minutes after the session). The main outcomes will be the HR and the Spo2 and will be evaluated before, during and after the exercise session using the Apple watch and the Polar HR monitor.

In this study it is hypothesized that the usage of this application can achieve a more effective lifestyle improvement than an intervention with the use of wearables, their respective generic applications and general healthy lifestyle recommendations. Therefore, this study aims to assess whether the incorporation of a mobile application such as CarpeDiem, which includes smart, personalized and holistic recommendations related to a healthy lifestyle (diet, physical activity and sleep) is associated with a more pronounced change in healthy lifestyle habits than a passive monitoring approach using wearables and the administration of general recommendations. This clinical trial consists of a multicenter pilot study performed at the headquarters of the Technology Center of Catalonia (Eurecat), randomized, parallel and controlled, performed with healthy adults (18 to 65 years old). 100 subjects will be recruited, 50 as an intervention group and 50 as a control group. The study is scheduled to begin in June 2021. Both groups will receive an activity tracker (Fitbit Inspire HR 2). The intervention group will also receive instructions to download and use the CarpeDiem application. Through the CarpeDiem application, participants will be able to answer follow-up questionnaires, perform missions related to the healthy consumption of various food groups, monitor their physical activity and sleep, and receive periodic, personalized and holistic recommendations based on the three pillars of health. The control group will receive instructions to download the Fitbit application and will additionally receive general recommendations for healthy lifestyle habits through standardized documents. Both groups will be provided access to the initial and final questionnaires that will be done online.

South Asian family caregivers are especially underserved and are a growing ethnic group in the US. Both PA and cognitive training (CT) have shown to improve cognitive function in older adults who experience cognitive function decline because of psychological stress. However, there are no studies using this approach for this population. We propose a randomized control trial pilot study to address this gap. Driven by a Community Advisory Committee (CAC) we will develop this 12-week mindful walking intervention using a participatory action research methodology in partnership with UIC's Cognition Behavior and Mindfulness Clinic that combines the PA of walking and the CT through mindfulness. We will recruit fifty participants and will randomly and equally assign 25 people to the intervention and 25 people to the control group. The intervention will include: 1) a mindful walking training followed by 2) a prescribed mindful walking regimen, 3) self-reporting of adherence to regimen by the participants using activity logbooks and use of a user-friendly PA tracker (Fitbit Charge HR) for daily step count, and 4) personalized text messages with reminders and motivational messages for participants to do the mindful walking as prescribed including a weekly check-in call or text message for accountability. The primary aim of the proposed pilot study is to evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of the protocol and intervention implementation. A secondary aim will evaluate the intervention to examine preliminary efficacy in reduction of psychological stress, improvement in cognitive function, increase in physical activity, and increased self-efficacy (self-efficacy for coping with stress, self-efficacy for physical activity, and overall self-efficacy).

            "Individuals who are overweight/obese are more vulnerable to type 2 diabetes (T2D). Current evidence suggests that PA, even without dietary prescription, can be efficacious in preventing T2D. Yet most Americans, especially those who are overweight/obese, are not physically active. Socioenvironmental barriers to physical activity (PA) such as body image concerns and limited access to fitness facilities contribute to the low levels of PA observed in overweight/obese adults. Web-based PA programs have been developed to address these barriers, but the outcomes have been marginal. Qualitative studies suggest that individuals who are overweight/obese prefer PA programs that feature people they can relate to especially in body size, fitness status and age. Previously, the investigators have included these preferences in a technology-based Physical Activity for The Heart (PATH) intervention that leverages open source platforms, such as YouTube, to promote PA in any setting. In this application, the investigators propose to test the feasibility and preliminary efficacy of PATH in promoting PA and reducing cardiometabolic risk in adults who are overweight/obese and at high risk of diabetes. In Aim 1 the investigators will conduct a 12-week randomized clinical trial including 52 adults who are overweight/obese and at high risk of diabetes to assess the feasibility and acceptability of PATH. In Aim 2 investigators will examine the trend in PA and cardiometabolic risk change from baseline to post-intervention. This approach is innovative because it leverages open source technologies to provide low-cost, action-oriented PA resources that match the preferences of adults who are overweight/obese. This contribution will be significant because PATH could offer a convenient, enjoyable and scalable program that features \"similar others\" to promote PA in overweight/obese adults at high risk of diabetes."

            "The benefits of physical activity (PA) for healthy aging are well known; however < 16% of U.S. older adults meet the federal recommendations for moderate to vigorous PA (MVPA). Asian Americans (AA) are a fast-growing segment of the older adult U.S. population and are likely to have limited English proficiency, lower-incomes, and low PA levels. Older AA adults are under represented in clinical trials and as a result, evidence-based PA programs remain inaccessible. Similarly, while the number of PA interventions for older adults incorporating technology to promote and sustain behavior change is increasing, the applicability and efficacy of these approaches for AA is poorly understood. Thus, there is a critical need to develop and test innovative PA interventions for this at-risk group. The primary objective of this study is to evaluate if a culturally and linguistically adapted community-based walking program enhanced with a cognitive behavioral intervention delivered via WeChat - a widely used Chinese social networking application - (enhanced walking) improves physical activity compared with walking only. Secondary objectives are to identify participant experiences in engaging in this platform to improve PA, and gain insights into the scalability of the intervention for future pivotal trials. The proposed research is a randomized, controlled trial that will recruit 60 community-dwelling Chinese older adults. The primary outcomes are PA (measured by FitBit step counts over time, and proportion meeting federal recommendations for moderate physical activity (MPA)). Secondary outcomes include patient-reported outcomes, and patient-reported experience measures. We aim to evaluate the acceptability of this enhanced program, and determine the feasibility of WeChat as a platform for increasing PA. The primary outcome will be analyzed using mixed effects ANOVA, and latent growth curve modeling. Secondary outcomes will be analyzed using linear regression. Semi-structured interviews will be conducted with participants upon program completion to identify contextual factors influencing application use, and thematic analysis will be used to examine relationships between these key factors. Results from this study will provide information about the applicability of mobile technology in supporting PA improvement among older Chinese, and valuable insight on contextual factors influencing application effectiveness, which will inform the potential for adoption and scale."

            "A growing body of evidence suggests that patients who receive good perioperative care (i.e. care prior to surgery, during surgery, and after surgery) tend to have fewer complications, quicker recovery times, and shorter hospital stays. A key component of good perioperative care is recognizing individuals who have diminished physiological reserves (i.e. those who are vulnerable or frail). The stress of an invasive procedure can exhaust the diminished reserves of patients who are frail, which can in turn lead to perioperative complications, mortality and an increase burden to the healthcare system. Early interventions in patients with diminished reserves can be applied to reduce the risk of complications and poor outcomes. There are emerging studies that show promising benefits of perioperative interventions, such as prehabilitation, though with some mixed findings. Exercise has been shown to reverse or modify the molecular driving factors of frailty, which involve dysregulation of cytokine and endocrine pathways. Physical inactivity and prolonged sedentary behaviors are also emerging concerns in frailty because of the implicated deleterious health effects. Sedentary behaviors are associated with prevalence and severity of frailty. Among pre-frail and frail inactive adults, sedentary time is associated with higher mortality. Increasing physical activity is recommended as the most feasible approach to prevent and treat frailty. The aim of this study is to determine if a prehabilitation intervention that combines neuromuscular strength training and intervention to reduce sedentary behavior reduces complications, length of stay, and patient recovery, thereby also reducing the burden on the healthcare system."

Up to 20% of adults in the United States suffer from insomnia disorder, and it has been associated with increased morbidity, mortality, and healthcare costs. Cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) is the initial recommended treatment approach for insomnia. Combined therapy with CBT-I and medication has shown no advantage over CBT-I alone.

Sedentary lifestyle, which is reported by 90% of older Americans, is an important risk factor for both cognitive decline and sleep disturbances. Although promoting physical activity has benefits to older adults' health, including sleep and cognition, traditional interventions to increase activity are challenging due to extensive staffing requirements and low adherence. Electronic activity monitors, such as wrist-worn accelerometers, can track heart rate, activity, and sleep to allow individuals to work towards personal activity and sleep goals. These appealing features make these devices ideal for interventions that aim to change behaviors and improve health outcomes. However, the efficacy of using electronic activity monitors to promote physical activity and health in older adults has not been examined. The investigators will conduct a randomized controlled trial in a cohort of older adults (without dementia) with both sedentary lifestyle and nocturnal sleep complaints to examine the effectiveness of a personalized behavioral intervention (compared to a control group) embedded within a smart watch application in older adults. 94 cognitively intact elders and 21 older adults with mild cognitive impairment will be enrolled and randomly allocated to the intervention or control group. Participants in the intervention arm will receive in person exercise training sessions, and personalized, self-monitor physical activity, receive interactive prompts, biweekly phone consultation with the research team, and financial incentives for achieving weekly physical activity goals. The control group will receive general education on physical activity in older adults and continue the routine daily activity during the intervention period.

In our previous study, we found that 20% of melanoma survivors reported a sunburn in the past year and 10% intentionally went outside for a tan, both strong indicators of inappropriate sun exposure. Melanoma survivors are at high risk of second melanomas, making it critical that they spend less time in the sun or take actions to protect themselves when they are in the sun. No studies to date have investigated technology-based strategies in melanoma survivors to improve sun exposure and protection behaviors. This project will test whether a wearable device that tracks sun exposure and provides alerts regarding sun exposure and protection behaviors will increase sun protection behaviors in melanoma survivors. The use of wearable technology devices (e.g., Fitbit) has grown quickly over the last decade and studies using these devices to promote physical activity and weight loss have been promising. We will test the technology device versus a similar control device in 368 melanoma survivors and compare sun protection behaviors between the two groups. This project has the potential to identify a strategy that could significantly lower the number of melanoma survivors who go on to have a second melanoma diagnosis. Importantly, this easy to use technology could also be utilized by survivors' family members, who are also at higher risk for melanoma, and the general population as a means to reduce risk of all forms of skin cancer."

Through a strong collaboration between the PM Cancer Rehabilitation and Survivorship (CRS) and alloBMT teams, the principal investigators developed an innovative multicomponent rehabilitation intervention for patients undergoing alloBMT (CaRE-4-alloBMT). CaRE-4-alloBMT uses a person- centred strategy and a multidimensional approach targeting physical activity, nutrition, psychosocial distress and promoting self-management skills. Innovative components of CaRE-4-alloBMT include:1) Individualized progressive exercise prescriptions developed and monitored by CRS registered kinesiologists and supported with a web/mobile application (Physitrack) that allows customizable exercise prescriptions, tracking of exercise completion, and video tutorials; 2) Individualized nutrition plans and stepped stratified care (education, counselling, intervention) based on nutritional status and delivered by registered dietitians (alloBMT and CRS). 3) On-line e-modules (developed in collaboration with PM Oncology Education) provide interactive education to promote self-management skills on crucial topics; 4) Remote monitoring using FitbitTM devices to monitor patients physical activity, caloric intake, and sleep for duration of the program; 5) Remote clinical support: Pre/Post discharge, patients will have scheduled (PHS) remote check-ins and health coaching sessions with a member of the CRS team (phone or MS Teams video). Objectives: i) To test the feasibility and safety of CaRE-4-alloBMT plus standard best practice cancer care compared to standard best practice cancer care alone; ii) To assess the preliminary efficacy of CaRE-4-alloBMT on physical function, disability, nutritional status, distress, QoL, healthcare utilization, and survival and estimate program return on investment."

            "Some people with cancer suffer from muscle wasting, lose weight and feel tired. This process, termed cachexia, is a significant problem and can lead to a reduction in both quality and quantity of life. Cachexia is caused by interactions between the tumour and the patient. Historically, it was considered to be a purely end-stage phenomenon of advanced cancer, however, it is now known that early signs of cachexia can even influence the outcomes of patients with potentially curative pathology, including those planned for a surgical resection. This study aims to collect information, from patients who are at risk of cachexia, about body composition, physical activity, quality of life and the body's immune response to cancer. Previously these measures have been most frequently studied in isolation, or at one single time-point, and are therefore likely to give an incomplete picture. A more holistic characterisation of surgical patients at risk of cancer cachexia, across their treatments, is currently lacking. Participants with cancer will be recruited to the study from surgical services in the United Kingdom (UK). A small number of 'control' patients without cancer, who are undergoing surgery for a benign condition, will also be recruited for comparison. Those recruited will have their height and weight measured, answer questionnaires about quality of life, undergo assessment of their physical function and levels of activity, have blood taken to analyse markers of inflammation and have their body composition measured by a variety of methods. A subgroup of patients will also undergo an additional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan of their abdomen and thighs. At the time of their operation, participants will also have small biopsies of muscle, fat, tumour and urine taken for biochemical analysis. Patients with cancer, will be asked to return for three follow up appointments during the year after their operation where these assessments will be repeated."

Recently, several studies suggested that cognitive training can improve gait in patients with PD (Peterson et al. 2016, Heremans et al. 2013), similar to the effects seen in the elderly (Yogev-Seligmann et al. 2008; Amboni et al. 2013). Specific training programs including dual tasking with automatic verbal series, counting etc. have led to increased walking speed and improved stepping cadence, length, and duration in patients with dementia (Schwenk et al. 2010). However, since in advanced PD patients dual-task gait training has to be supervised by therapists, it is not a suitable type of therapy to be performed at home. Therefore, this study aims to verify and extend the encouraging results of the single study which showed a positive effect of cognitive function training on gait in PD (Milman et al. 2014) by exploring this effect in advanced PD patients, by assessing the effect on gait using more targeted clinical and instrumental evaluation, and by comparing two modes of therapy delivery, group and computer-based."

The purpose of the study is to evaluate the combination of these strategies that maximizes 6-month weight loss in the context of a standalone digital health intervention for adults with overweight or obesity. The investigators will recruit 176 total participants to the trial. Recruitment will occur through remote channels. Interested individuals will be directed to an online screening questionnaire; those who are eligible will then be invited to attend an initial remote session with study personnel to ensure interest and eligibility in the study. The weight loss intervention will last 6 months, and all participants will receive a \"core\" treatment consisting of goal setting, behavioral lessons, action plans, and tailored feedback - all of which will be delivered remotely. Depending on which group participants are assigned to in the study, some individuals will be asked to track their dietary intake, their steps, and/or their body weight via digital tools. All study tasks will occur remotely, thus, participants never need to come in-person for any intervention or assessment tasks. The investigators will use the Multiphase Optimization Strategy (MOST) framework to identify the most effective combination of self-monitoring strategies. The factorial design will allow the research team to determine the unique and combined impact of each self-monitoring component on weight change. The primary outcome is weight change from baseline to 6 months. The research team will also assess self-monitoring engagement over 6 months and its association with weight change. To complement the main trial, the research team will also randomize half of participants to receive an interactive orientation video, in order to assess its impact on trial retention at 6 months. Overall, the information gathered from this trial will enable the construction of an optimized digital health intervention for weight loss that can be delivered remotely, which, if found to be effective, could have high potential for scalability."

However, men are dramatically underrepresented in weight loss programs. Attempts to modestly adapt standard weight loss programs have seen only minimal success. Mobile applications (mHealth apps) have attractive features, but have low male enrollment and poor efficacy as conventionally delivered. A gamified mHealth program offers the possibility of engaging men and enhancing efficacy given that (1) video gaming is highly appealing to men; (2) gamification features (e.g., digital rewards for attaining \"streaks\" and milestones, competition) are known enhance enjoyment and motivation and facilitate desired behaviors; and (3) \"neurotraining\" video games featuring repetitive action mechanics, adaptive difficulty, and feedback can train inhibitory control, a basic brain capacity to inhibit intrinsically-generated approach responses that is strongly linked to body mass and the consumption of high-calorie foods. This project evaluates long-term engagement and outcomes of a professionally-designed, game-based weight loss program. As such, 228 overweight men will be randomized to: (1) a 12-month mHealth weight loss program that includes digital self-monitoring, simplified and self-selected dietary targets, physical activity and a control (sham) non-game neurotraining, or (2) a fully-gamified version of this same program, comprised of a behavior change program featuring team-based competition, digital reinforcers for attainment of streaks and milestones, and an integrated neurotraining video game. Aims include evaluating the efficacy of the gamified program in terms of weight loss, diet and physical activity at 12 months, as well as evaluating hypothesized mediators (inhibitory control and engagement), (enjoyment and compliance) and moderators (baseline frequency of video game play and implicit preferences for Inhibitory Control Training-targeted foods)."

Pain management programmes are the recommended treatment for chronic pain, however a number of barriers to their widespread implementation have been identified including geographical distance from speciality programmes, functional disability limiting the mobility of people with CP and economic limitations(1). eHealth interventions have the potential to address a number of these barriers and recent reviews have reported reductions in pain(2), improved knowledge and understanding about chronic pain and chronic pain management, improved function(3) and improvements in quality of life(4) following eHealth interventions. The intervention in this study will be delivered online. Participants will be randomly allocated to a combined MBSR and exercise programme (Group A) or an online self-management guide (Group B). Group A will take part in an 8 week live online weekly mindfulness sessions based on the Mindfulness Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) programme facilitated by a qualified mindfulness teacher, in addition to a supervised exercise classes led by a Physiotherapist. Group B will receive access to an 8 week online self-management guide containing 8 self-directed guides, which will be made available to participants biweekly. Outcomes of feasibility and acceptability will be investigated in addition to a preliminary examination of between group clinical effects at baseline immediately post intervention and at a three month follow up, using validated patient reported outcome measures.

            "Multimorbidity (i.e., the coexistence of 2 or more chronic conditions in an individual) is increasingly recognized as a pressing public health problem. Effective interventions targeting coexisting depression and obesity are critical given the high prevalence and worsened outcomes for patients with both conditions. ENGAGE-2 is a pilot randomized controlled trial (RCT). The objective is to investigate the outcomes and mechanisms of an integrated depression and obesity intervention that combines collaborative stepped depression treatment and evidence-based behavioral weight loss treatment. The Integrated Coaching for Better Mood and Weight-2 (I-CARE2) intervention synergistically integrates 2 proven national programs: the Program to Encourage Active and Rewarding Lives (PEARLS) for depression care and the Group Lifestyle Balance (GLB) program for weight loss and cardiometabolic risk reduction. In Phase 1 of the ENGAGE project, investigators developed a new protocol to quantify activation and connectivity of the Affective, Cognitive Control, and Default Mode brain circuits from functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) among 108 depressed obese patients. Investigators implement the same fMRI protocol in this second phase of the project to examine the mechanistic role of these brain circuits as potential neural targets in treatment engagement and response in the I-CARE2 intervention. A new sample of 105 depressed obese patients are randomized in a 2:1 ratio to receive the I-CARE2 intervention (n=70) or usual care (n=35). Study assessments occur at 0 (baseline), 2 and 6 months. Investigators hypothesize that 1 or more of the neural targets under study will moderate (baseline state) and/or mediate (change at follow-up) the effect of the I-CARE2 intervention versus usual care on health behaviors (problem-solving ability, dietary intakes, physical activity) and clinical outcomes (weight loss, depression, anxiety)."

Study sample: Female and male patients aged 18 years or over, with documented stable CAD and referred for cardiac rehabilitation (at > 2 weeks but <10 weeks after PCI or >4 weeks but <12 weeks after CABG or MI: STEM or non-STEMI), and/or having documented CAD by coronary angiography (stenosis in a major coronary artery >50%). Intervention: Patients randomized to the intervention group will receive the TIMELY app on their phones or tablets for 6 months. Patients will also receive a wearable activity tracker that collects activity levels, heart rate and sleep characteristics. Based on patient's activity levels, self-reported momentary mental states, health-related behaviors and environmental and clinical background factors, the app will enable patient-tailored recommendations relevant to improving lifestyle behaviors during daily life. In addition, patients will receive a blood pressure monitor that measures hemodynamic parameters through pulse wave analysis and an easy-to-use ECG device which will be used to assess changes in heart rate and other cardiovascular measures at rest and with exercise. Main study parameters/endpoints: The primary biomedical outcome is a change in the CoroPredict biomarker risk score from baseline (pre-randomization) to completion of the active intervention phase (6 months). The CoroPredict score is an indicator of the 10-year risk of mortality. The primary behavioral outcome is the change from baseline to 6 months in patients' functional status of fitness level (measured using the 6-minute walk test). The study further aims to improve secondary outcome measures: physical activity levels during daily life and cardiovascular responses to exercise, dietary habits, smoking behavior, medication adherence and perceived levels of psychological stress."

            "Background: Exercise, or physical activity, is beneficial for all cancer survivors. Despite this knowledge, there is generally a gap between the evidence and practice. And this gap is widened with (a) underserved tumour groups in exercise oncology, such as neuro-oncology patients, or (b) underutilized timelines across the cancer treatment phases to deliver exercise oncology education or programming. Thus, our current work is building a hybrid implementation effectiveness study into the clinical care pathway across Alberta in neuro-oncology - ACE-Neuro. Objectives: The purpose of this study is to assess the impact of an online, tailored exercise oncology program for neuro-oncology patients using a participant-oriented research (POR) approach as well as both quantitative and qualitative research methods. Specifically, the primary outcome of this study is to determine the feasibility of recruitment, referral, triage, adherence, and adverse events. The secondary outcome is to examine the preliminary effectiveness of the neuro-oncology exercise program on patient-reported outcomes and physical function. Methods: Neuro-oncology patients >18 years and able to consent in English will be referred to a study-based Rehabilitation Triage Clinic, where a Physician-Researcher will assess patients on their overall health and functional status, and next triage them to either ACE-Neuro, rehabilitation oncology, or cancer physiatry. Once referred to ACE-Neuro, participants will partake in a 12-week online exercise program, delivered by a Clinical Exercise Physiologist. Participants will complete online assessments of physical function, patient-reported outcomes, and objective physical activity at baseline (pre-program), 12-weeks (post-program completion), 6-months, and 12-months. The exercise program includes weekly one-on-one online exercise delivery, health coaching to support behaviour change, and access to an online group exercise session. Participants will also be invited to a post-program qualitative interview to get perspectives on their experiences participating in ACE-Neuro. Relevance: By working directly with patients, healthcare providers, and community partners, this implementation project will develop a framework that streamlines patient triage, and provides a tailored online exercise program for neuro-oncology patients, thereby advancing exercise oncology research and clinical practice."

Background: Centre-based cardiac rehabilitation (CBCR) participation rates among eligible patients remain low at 10-30% worldwide and less than 10% in Singapore, reportedly due to long-standing challenges surrounding accessibility, conflicting commitments, low socioeconomic status, and costs. A recent challenge is the COVID-19 pandemic, that resulted in the partial or complete closures of CBCR programmes Alternative strategies to deliver cardiac rehabilitation using novel technologies are needed to increase participation rates and improve health outcomes. Design: A single-blinded two-arm randomised controlled trial (RCT) will be adopted. Methodology: The is a two-phase study. Phase one involves the development and field-testing of the I-CREST system. The I-CREST system comprises of a smartphone application, a wearable heart rate monitor and a web-portal. Phase two is a single-blinded two-arm RCT with repeated measures. 124 participants will be recruited from the National University Hospital in Singapore and will be randomly allocated to intervention or control group. Participants in the intervention group will receive the 6-week I-CREST intervention - including the newly developed I-CREST system, one face-to-face training session, and weekly telephone calls.

Data will be collected at baseline, at 6 weeks (after completion of the CR programme), at 3months and at 6months from baseline. Sociodemographic and clinical data will also be collected. A cost-effectiveness analysis will also be performed to evaluate the feasibility of I-CREST compared to the CBCR platform. To assess the participants' experiences of the I-CREST system, a process evaluation will be undertaken at the conclusion of the study. Significance. This study will generate insights into the suitability and effectiveness of I-CREST as an alternative to traditional CBCR outpatient services."

Studies demonstrate that biomarkers can help to distinguish different forms of depression. Simple markers, like aldosterone from the saliva, blood pressure and inflammation markers from the blood, have been identified as predictors of a more difficult to treat depression. Enoxolone is a molecule derived from the licorice plant and has demonstrated an effect on these biomarkers, which may indicate a better response. In a randomized placebo controlled trial this study is assessing whether the administration of enoxolone vs. placebo can change these markers and if patients benefit from these biomarker changes clinically. In addition, this study records the volume and structure of certain brain areas, which could be involved in this action."

            "Ovarian cancer (OC) is the fifth most common cause of cancer death. More than 40% are older than 70 years. The standard treatment is radical surgery combined with chemotherapy. More than 40% of the Danish patients will never undergo surgery. Frail and immunodeficient older patients are at higher risk of complications, and immunomodulating treatment as chemotherapy results in different outcomes in comparable patients. No accurate validated screening tool to identify frail and immunodeficient OC women exists. Optimization through comprehensive geriatric assessment (CGA) and physical training before and during treatment may improve outcomes and decrease associated risks. Aim: Primary endpoints will be to determine whether a CGA and physical training vs standard of care can increase the proportion of patients later on referred to interval debulking surgery, and examine the performance of validated screening tests in predicting impairments in CGA. Other endpoints will be to evaluate if intervention can improve completion of chemotherapy, to examine the association between frailty screening scores and selected biomarkers with treatment outcomes, including complications and quality of life, and ultimately to develop an improved frailty screening tool based on known screening tools, functional tests and biomarkers identifying patients who will benefit from CGA. Method: This is a nationwide, randomized intervention study. Patients \u226570 years diagnosed with primary OC at the Gynecological departments of Rigshospitalet, Odense and Roskilde University Hospitals will be included. In an interdisciplinary collaboration between medical specialists in oncology, gynecology and geriatrics, included patients will be screened for frailty using validated screening tools and functional tests. Specific biomarkers and immunologic profile will be assessed in all patients. Patients selected for neoadjuvant chemotherapy will be randomized to receive CGA or standard of care. Patients selected for primary debulking surgery or palliation will be followed in an observational cohort. Perspective: The development of a validated screening tool for frailty assessment and immunological status will help us identify frail patients who may need optimization before treatment, resulting in more patients getting optimal treatment (either surgery or chemotherapy), prevent post-treatment complications and avoid palliative patients from undergoing a redundant complex treatment."

Studies characterizing the improvement of acute sleep parameters after the initiation of CPAP are limited to one or two nights of polysomnographic recording. This is related to the cost of performing these studies with repeated recordings in the laboratory and to the acceptability by patients to perform multiple nights of recordings. Investigators currently have powerful and reliable methods allowing us to carry out nights at home in the patient's ecosystem, in real-life conditions. The characterization of sleep parameters by these methods is equivalent to a polysomnographic recording. These technological innovations will allow us to characterize sleep before the initiation of CPAP treatment during several nights performed at home. Investigators will then be able to characterize the kinetics and stability of the improvement of sleep parameters in patients with obstructive sleep apnea syndrome in whom continuous positive airway pressure is initiated. These data will be original and will serve as exploratory data to judge whether the objective improvement of sleep parameters in the first weeks of treatment is associated with improvement in sleepiness, quality of life, and compliance with treatment."

Different professional societies, including the German Society of Pneumology and the European Respiratory Society, recommend rehabilitation intervention to reduce the sequelae of COVID-19. However, from the perspective of science and practice, there are relevant areas that have been insufficiently investigated and are essential for the treatment success of post/long COVID patients: - Differentiation of rehabilitation effects from natural recovery after COVID-19. - Lack of personalized and symptom-based treatment approaches that can address the heterogeneity of symptoms in post/long COVID - Lack of uniform, high-quality rehabilitation standards in post-/long-COVID. Therefore, post-COVID patients will be recruited at several post-COVID practices around Germany and randomized to receive (A) a rehabilitation program or (B) usual care. The primary objective of this randomized controlled trial (RCT) is to investigate whether a 3-week symptom-oriented, inpatient, multidisciplinary rehabilitation intervention, whose content focus is standardized according to cluster assignment (fatigue, cognition, soma), has a positive effect on the quality of life (primary outcome) in post-COVID syndrome patients compared to a usual care group (standard outpatient care). All study participants will be provided with a continuous telemonitoring system (SaniQ app) throughout the study period.

In addition, Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a common comorbidity associated with overweight and obesity and counts for 5% of the French population under 65 years of age and 15% in people over 65 years old. Despite the accumulation of scientific evidence supporting the benefits of physical activity, obese and diabetic people remain insufficiently active and current programs struggle to engage and sustain physical activity of patients over long periods of time. It is therefore urgent to develop interventions that can effectively change individuals' behavior. In this context, \"e-health\" interventions and gamification appear to be a particularly promising avenue to improve physical activity and reduce attrition rates of current programs. This clinical trial aim to test the effectiveness of a digital intervention based on gamification and teamwork in comparison to a supervised physical activity program. The investigators hypothesized that the intervention will be efficient by the development of a self-determined motivation through the process of gamification on the one hand. On the other hand, through the in-group collaboration with other people who share the same stigmatized criteria that will help participants to overcome weight stigmas, acting generally as physical activity barriers."

Families (n=25) that consist of at least one adult with (in risk of) type 2 diabetes living in the same household with at least one 5-18 yeard old child, and at least one family member living sedentary lifestyle, will participate. Intervention: The 3-months long hybrid telehealth/face-to-face intervention with weekly 1-hour contacts with health professionals will deliver diabetes education and tailored support to implement more physical activity and healthy meals in the family everyday life. A 3-months long supervised maintenance phase with monthly professional contacts will be included. Outcomes: Feasibility evaluation will be conducted using quantitative (quantifiable) and qualitative research methods. The feasibility data will be the primary outcomes of the study, collected and evaluated using the predefined research progression criteria applied the green-amber-red method. Sociodemography and secondary outcomes, such as physical activity, dieting habits, daily occupations, occupational balance, health and quality of life will be assessed at baseline and 3 and 6-months follow-ups. The quantitative results will be comprehended through qualitative data from participant interviews which will nuance the feasibility evaluation. Analysis: Relevant statistical methods and qualitative analysis method will be applied. Expected results: The intervention will help families achieve sustainable lifestyle changes, e.g., diabetes stabilized blood glucose in adults with type 2 diabetes, increased physical activity time and improved dieting habits, for better family health and well-being. Ethics and dissemination: The trial does not have any obvious health risks for the participants. All the results - significant, non-significant and/ or inconclusive - will be reported."

            "Aging is associated with a decline in muscle mass, strength, and physical function, leading to muscle mass loss and weakness. These concerns can impact an individual's functional independence and quality of life (QOL). Dietary protein stimulates muscle protein growth. Current studies suggest that optimal protein intake for older adults is greater than the Recommended Dietary Allowance. Barriers to consuming protein-rich foods in older adults include reductions in taste and smell, dentition, dexterity, and changes in living situation. Therefore, nutritional interventions are needed to effectively improve eating behaviors, diet quality, and stimulate muscle growth and strength. These interventions will help prevent, manage, and promote muscle mass loss recovery. Older adults may not be aware of their changing nutrient needs and therefore may lack the skills to prepare nutritionally adequate foods properly. Cooking demonstrations, or culinary medicine (CM), can help teach healthy cooking to reduce potential red meat consumption barriers and improve community-dwelling older adults' dietary habits. Thus, CM can be a novel strategy to improve diet quality in older adults and promote and augment at-home cooking. CM is an evidenced-base field that combines skills of preparing, cooking, and presenting food with the science of medicine. This field can help to accomplish potential eating behaviors and health outcome improvements. A tailored CM program can be an effective strategy that could reduce barriers in protein intake that will enable older adults to age well and productively."

The HR is an important measure to determine the recommended exercise training intensity and to monitor the training intensity in patients with cardiac diseases. The target exercise training intensity during cardiac rehabilitation is between 40% to 70% of heart rate reserve (HRR). Also, cardiac patients who have hypoxemia are advised to continuously monitor their Spo2. Therefore, this study aims to investigate the accuracy of the Apple Watch in measuring the HR and Spo2 in Saudi patients with cardiac diseases. Method: A cross sectional study will be invited one-hundred cardiac patients will be invited and recruited to participate in this study and the eligible participants will be randomly allocated into two groups. The first group (Group-A) will include the cardiac patients with regular HR and the second group (Group-B) will include the cardiac patients with irregular HR. Both groups will use the apple watch to evaluate the HR and the Spo2 against the Polar HR monitor and pulse oximeter at rest, during, and after the mild to moderate intensity exercise training session (40% to 70% HRR).

            "Changes in Peak Fat Oxidation and Aerobic Fitness During Pre-season in Sub-elite Football Players",
            "Cross-sectional studies clearly demonstrate that the maximal fat oxidation (MFO, onwards referred to as peak fat oxidation, PFO) and the intensity at which it occurs (Fatmax) are higher in trained compared with untrained men and women (Maunder et al. 2018; Nordby et al. 2006; Lima-Silva et al. 2010). Furthermore, a recent study in endurance-trained males have shown a relationship between PFO and performance in an Ironman triathlon (Frandsen et al. 2017). The interest of PFO and Fatmax in endurance sports is centered on the speculation that increased fat oxidation rates during exercise would benefit endurance performance (> 4 hours) due to a glycogen sparing effect. Furthermore, it is speculated that the high amount of low-intensity training (70-80%), as seen with elite endurance athletes, might be essential in order to increase the fat oxidation capacity. However, when PFO is compared across an athletic population, football players have similar values as endurance-trained athletes (Randell et al. 2016; Randell et al. 2019; Frandsen et al. 2017), which is somewhat surprising when the different training regimes are considered. It is noteworthy that the variations in PFO in various types of athletes and football players are considerable (Randell et al. 2016). However, different playing position in football has different work requirements, thus it might be that some of the variation seen in PFO could be related to the different playing position. To our knowledge, no study has previously looked at the variations in fat oxidation capacity before and after a training period in athletes. Therefore, the aim of the present study is to investigate changes in peak fat oxidation and aerobic fitness during a pre-season training period in sub-elite football players. A secondary aim is to investigate if the changes are related to specific playing positions on the field. The overall hypothesis is that a pre-season training period would increase the fat oxidation capacity and aerobic fitness, and that the changes are related to specific player positions."

            "Cystic fibrosis (CF) is the UK s most common inherited genetic condition and affects more than 10,500 people. The disease causes problems with the movement of salt and water in the body, resulting in sticky mucus building up, mostly in the lungs and gut. Thick mucus in the airways leads to repeated infections which, over time, damage the lungs. Chest physiotherapy is prescribed to loosen and clear sticky thick mucus from the airways and so to help to reduce lung infection. Chest physiotherapy is a routine treatment to keep people with CF healthy. However, many say it is time-consuming and a burden. People with CF have asked if doing exercise could have the same effect as chest physiotherapy sessions for helping clear mucus. Exercise could be more enjoyable and less burdensome. Through a recognised priority setting partnership, the CF community recently ranked research to reduce the burden of their care and answer whether exercise can replace chest physiotherapy , as their number 1 and 7 priorities. Surveys show that many people with CF have occasionally chosen to replace chest physiotherapy with exercise for airway clearance, and we recently confirmed this through a UK-wide survey. It is not known if they would be willing to take part in research that asks some to stop chest physiotherapy and to exercise (with coughs and huffs) instead. New medicine (modulators) have recently become available for many people with CF, bringing dramatic improvements in their health. Some people who have started modulators are considering whether they can reduce or stop treatments - including chest physiotherapy. So, the effects of stopping chest physiotherapy need to be investigated and also if exercise can be used instead - this research study aims to understand this. A recent survey in people with CF, their families, physiotherapists and doctors, conducted by this research team, showed us that many consider hard exercise with coughs and huffs to be able to clear mucus from the airways. This study will recruit 50 people with CF (>12 years old) for 28-days. This study will ask half of them to continue their usual care, and half to stop chest physiotherapy and do exercise that gets them breathing deeply (with coughs and huffs) instead. This study will see if people are willing to start and continue with such a study and what they think of the study processes. It will also see how stopping chest physiotherapy and replacing it with exercise affects measurements of their lung function. The study will also involve talking with people with CF and members of their CF team to understand their experiences. This information will reveal whether a larger study can answer the question of whether certain forms of exercise can safely be used as an alternative to chest physiotherapy."

            "Weight Loss and Physical Fitness Following Pregnancy in Active Duty Women",
            "Pregnancy and delivery are major stressors on the female body and contribute significantly to permanent weight gain and associated morbidity in women. This can profoundly affect the ability of active duty (AD) women to advance in their career. The first 12 weeks postpartum are the time period during which the most significant weight loss occurs and is critical in achieving a healthy weight in the first year postpartum. Many factors contribute to effective weight loss in this period among which the most critical are diet, exercise, and sleep. Breast feeding and depression may also affect weight changes postpartum. Research has shown diet to likely be the most crucial of these factors. The PADaWL study is designed as a randomized controlled trial to assess the effects of dietary intervention on weight and physical fitness versus routine postpartum care in the first year postpartum. Subjects will be primiparous AD women from any military service recruited in the obstetric clinic in the third trimester of pregnancy at Tripler Army Medical Center. Data will collected in an ambi-directional fashion with pre-pregnancy physical fitness data, demographic and pregnancy data collected at time of enrollment. Subjects will be randomized to receive intensive virtual sessions with a dietician vs routine postpartum care for the first 12 months postpartum. We will utilize a biometric device to monitor activity levels and sleep, web-based diaries to monitor breast feeding and diet, and validated questionnaires to evaluate depression as well as diet and sleep. Subjects will be monitored weekly for the first 12 weeks postpartum and will then be further evaluated at 6, 9 and 12 months postpartum. Primary outcome is weight at 12weeks postpartum and whether subjects have achieved military standards. Secondary outcome will be weight at 12 months postpartum and whether subject has achieved weight and fitness standards. The study intends to collect large amounts of data, and we intend to analyze which factors may be contributing to weight retention postpartum. This study should provide an accurate assessment of the effects of pregnancy on AD women. It should generate a clean and accurate dataset on which multiple follow-on studies can be performed and provide data for designing further intervention studies in postpartum women. The results of this study should also be able to assist in developing policy and guidance concerning AD women and pregnancy."

            "This study aims to investigate the effectiveness of various recovery strategies (such as longer recovery periods or reduced exercise intensity) in optimizing both physical performance and overall health status. Furthermore, the study will explore the potential of using changes in blood and urinary markers as indicators for assessing recovery status. This study will assess whether extending recovery periods between exercise sessions and reducing the volume of exercise training can enhance the recovery process and enhance performance and health-related markers, relative to a control group. One hundred-fifth young males will be recruited to participate in a single-center, parallel-group, randomized, well-controlled, superiority trial for 8 weeks of high-volume exercise training. A single-center, parallel-group, randomized, well-controlled, superiority trial will be conducted among 150 physically active young males. Participants will undergo an 8-week high-volume exercise during base training program, which they will be randomly assigned to one of three groups: (1) a control group, which will follow the standard exercise regimen of 35 hours/week (n = 50); (2) a less exercise volume group, which will reduce exercise volume by 15% to 30 hours/week (n = 50); and (3) an extended recovery group, which will perform the same volume of exercise as the control group (35 hours/week), but with longer recovery intervals between exercises (n = 50). The intervention will take place at the Ministry of Defense training platform. All study measurements will be taken at baseline and throughout the study. Body composition will be assessed using multichannel bioelectrical impedance (Seca). Continuously monitor (Garmin) will be used to evaluate heart rate and heart rate variability. Fasting blood samples will be used to examine inflammatory, lipid, glycemic, and endocrine markers. Physical performance will be assessed by several validated assessments, including handgrip, maximal voluntary contraction, Wingate test, Isometric Mid-Thigh Pull (IMTP), counter movement jump (CMJ) and maximal oxygen consumption (VO2max)."

Unfortunately, few patients attend CR, often reporting several barriers to access including travel distance, parking fees and lack of time. Advances in technology have the potential to improve accessibility and delivery of CR programs, and improve patient empowerment. The University of Ottawa Heart Institute has developed an e-health program called the Virtual Cardiac Rehabilitation Program (VCRP); an online cardiovascular health management system (website & Smartphone app) that provides strategies for the control and management of risk factors. The goals of VCRP are to: empower and educate patients; foster better communication between patients and their health care team; stimulate shared decision making; and, facilitate care coordination leading to better health outcomes. The VCRP provides patients with: real-time access to their health information, as well as tracking of risk behaviours and factors through integration with devices; a wellness plan; access to a personal on-line health coach; goal-setting notifications; on-line community forums; and, circle of care access to information. The aim of this project is to evaluate the effects of VCRP (with integrated fitness tracker) compared to a standard, home-based CR program. The study will look at changes in: patient empowerment; health behaviours; risk factors; quality of life; clinical outcomes; and, costs. The study will improve our understanding of: patient and provider needs; program usability; and shared decision-making. Results will inform the use of e-health programs such as VCRP into healthcare settings to improve patient empowerment, shared decision-making, and the ability to integrate wearable monitors to improve health behaviours."

Males and females with T2DM from the city of Pelotas/RS who meet the study eligibility criteria will participate in the study. Participants will be randomized into the intervention group (IG) and control group (CG). The IG will perform a 12-week exercise program supervised remotely via video call, while GC will receive recommendations for physical activity. Participants will be evaluated at baseline (week 0) and after intervention (week 13). Initially, data for sample characterization, blood pressure, capillary blood glucose, and functional tests will collect during a home visit. In a second moment, participants will be invited to go to a specific laboratory for collecting glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c). Subsequently, a third date will be scheduled to apply self-administered questionnaires (online via GoogleDocs) related to the quality of life, sleep quality, depressive symptoms, emotional stress related to diabetes, level of physical activity, and eating habits. Additionally, acute glycemic responses will be evaluated before and immediately after an exercise session three times throughout the intervention. Capillary blood glucose will be collected in sessions performed in the initial period of mesocycles 1, 2, and 4. At week 13, reassessment will be realized by the same baseline assessors. Over the 12 weeks, a combined training will be carried out with remote supervision. Participants will perform strength exercises at usual and maximum execution speed and aerobic exercises at a rating of perceived effort between 11 and 15 on Borg's scale. The sessions will have a total duration between 37 and 57 min and a weekly frequency of two weekly sessions in the first six weeks and three weekly sessions in the remaining six weeks. Data will be expressed as mean and standard deviation. Data analysis between pre-and post-intervention moments, as well as between groups, will be performed by Generalized Estimated Equations, with Bonferroni post hoc, considering both per-protocol (including participants who meet 70% of frequency in the intervention) and intention to treat analysis (including all randomized participants), assuming an alpha level of 5%."

            "Both single-balloon enteroscopy (SBE) and novel motorized spiral enteroscopy (NMSE) are effective techniques for small bowel endoscopy in suspected Crohn's disease (CD). Small bowel endoscopy is indicated for confirming diagnosis when CD is suspected based on clinical features along with cross-sectional small bowel imaging (computed tomography enterography/enteroclysis: CTE or magnetic resonance enterography/enteroclysis: MRE) or capsule endoscopy (CE). It not only helps in diagnosing CD, but it also helps in excluding CD, diagnosing alternate conditions and taking a surgical decision if a tight stricture is found. The pilot study done by the investigators in 177 suspected CD patients (37.2% female, 7-75 years) undergoing total 201 device assisted enteroscopy (DAE) showed that NMSE scores over SBE with regards to small bowel evaluation with complete small bowel coverage and shorter procedure time. The investigators aim to validate this findings by comparing technical performance and diagnostic yield between NMSE (Olympus Medical, Tokyo, Japan) and SBE (Olympus Medical Systems Corporation, Tokyo, Japan) for small bowel evaluation. Additionally the investigators plan to compare depth of insertion, total enteroscopy rates, procedure time, adverse event rates between the two modalities. To date, no study has compared both modalities in suspected Crohn's disease (CD) requiring small bowel evaluation in a randomized manner. Hence the investigators intend to perform a randomized controlled study based on these preliminary finding with appropriate matching and parallel study design in larger numbers."

In a hospital setting, healthcare professionals frequently come across children who have experienced abuse and/or neglect. Nurses are often the first to encounter the child and their family, initiating the process of taking a medical history and establishing closer interactions during care and treatment. To accurately recognize the case and provide appropriate care using the right approach, nurses need to possess sufficient knowledge and skills related to child abuse and neglect. The lack of adequate education on child abuse and neglect, as well as insufficient research on the subject, can lead to a lack of information and cases being overlooked. To identify and report cases of child abuse and neglect, it is important for nurses, especially before starting their profession, to have a sufficient level of knowledge about the signs and risks of child abuse and neglect.

It is known that especially stress and anxiety affect the number and severity of flare-ups in ulcerative colitis patients. It is thought that this study will contribute to the self-management behaviors of ulcerative colitis patients in the rare diseases group for the Turkish population and fill the gap in the literature."

            "According to Diabetes Canada (\"DC\"), in 2015, the estimated prevalence of prediabetes in Canada (>20 years of age) is 5.7 million people (22.1%). This rate is estimated to increase to 6.4 million people (23.2%) by 2025. Risk factors contributing to prediabetes and consequently Type 2 Diabetes include rising obesity rates, lack of physical activity, an aging population, and the cultural diversity of Canada . There is convincing evidence that modifiable risk factors, such as diet and physical activity reduce the development of Type 2 Diabetes with the benefits extending beyond the active intervention stage. The underlying theory that supports this intervention relates to the imperative need to focus on weight loss and physical activity, with this population that is at risk of developing diabetes, due to its relationship with insulin resistance. DC outlines the importance of intensive and structured lifestyle modification to promote weight loss in order to reduce the progression of prediabetes to diabetes."

            "Surgery is the mainstay of treatment for patients with early-disease esophageal and gastric cancer. Open surgery for oesophageal cancer commonly involves large incisions in the chest, which is associated with a high rate of respiratory complications in the postoperative period. Patients with oesophageal or gastric cancer furthermore commonly present with significant weight loss, affecting both muscle mass and muscle strength. This could further decrease the physical fitness and increase the risk for experiencing complications after treatment. Patients also report a decreased physical functioning in quality of life at least 3 years after surgery, suggesting this is a persistent deficit. Currently, no long-term data is available assessing physical activity levels in oesophageal or gastric cancer survivors. Thus, quantifying physical activity levels in these patients may identify the period in which patients' activity levels are most likely to deteriorate. Activity levels will be assessed from Google Location History from the patient's phone, providing summary of physical activity over time. This information could be used in the future to provide adequate physical therapy intervention which might improve recovery in several aspects, such as physical fitness but also respiratory function and quality of life."

            "Internet-delivered cognitive behaviour therapy (ICBT) shows considerable promise as a convenient treatment for alcohol misuse. ICBT may differ in whether the user works alone (self-guided) or along with an individual who guides treatment (e.g., therapist/health educator). Guided ICBT involves completing online lessons over several weeks coupled with support from a guide in the form of emails, online messages and/or brief telephone calls. Self-guided ICBT allows users to complete lessons by themselves without any contact with a guide. In some studies, guided-ICBT has shown greater reductions in alcohol consumption than self-guided ICBT. Further, some research on alcohol treatment shows that assessment in itself may have an effect on alcohol consumption, a phenomenon referred to in the literature as \"assessment reactivity\". It is believed that verbalizing one's drinking problems to another person might lead to greater realization of the problem extent and severity, which in turn can lead to initiation of the change process. Experimental studies have shown that extended and frequent assessments lead to greater alcohol reductions compared to brief and infrequent assessments. Although ICBT for alcohol misuse is an attractive treatment option, it is not often available to clients as part of routine care. The Online Therapy Unit at the University of Regina is currently exploring extending services to include guided ICBT for alcohol misuse. The Unit has been providing treatment in ICBT for depression and anxiety as well as various health conditions since 2010 and has offered treatment to ~4200 individuals. The purpose of this study is to evaluate ICBT for individuals with alcohol misuse within the routine online clinic, and to investigate ways to optimize future modes of delivery. Of specific interest in this study, is how outcomes vary depending on whether or not weekly guidance from a health educator is available and whether or not an initial extended assessment telephone call is included or not compared to a briefer screening telephone call. Of interest will also be if the extended assessment leads to greater alcohol reductions and higher motivation pre-treatment."

Links between opioid misuse and mortality are well-known; nearly 70% of all drug overdose deaths in 2017 were attributable to opioids. Given their pain-relieving properties, opioids have been widely used in the chronic pain population who are also susceptible to misuse of these analgesics.. In chronic pain patients with anger, the pain as well as opioid use may be aggravated. For example, suppression of anger has been linked with increased pain sensitivity in experiments, while anger-hostility scores and internalized anger predict pain severity variance and pain intensity, respectively. Anger is also linked with drug use/abuse, including opioids. The goal of this research is to implement a state-of-the-art program for anger regulation in chronic pain patients., Called Cognitive Behavioral Affective Therapy (CBAT), this program is evaluated on multiple measures of anger, sensory versus affective measures of pain, and measures of opioid misuse. CBAT is expected to reduce anger, and thereby produce reduction in pain as well as shift attitudes away from opioid misuse.."

DESIGN OF THE STUDY This is a multicenter study composed of a first phase of prospective data collection from patients that undergo laparoscopic surgery with a diagnosis of SBO and undergo Indocyanine green (ICG) fluorescence angiography (FA) for doubts about bowel viability after the resolution of the obstructive mechanism; the second phase of retrospective analysis to develop the Resectability Score. METHODS The FA should be performed in all patients undergoing laparoscopic surgery for SBO that presents concerns bowel viability after the resolution of the occlusive mechanism, with consequent intraoperative enrolment in the study Registry. The investigators adopted the modified Bulkley classification of the fluorescent patterns to identify which patients need more FA to assess bowel vitality. It is expected that most patients for whom the FA will be performed are those with patterns 2 or 3, representing the study's primary object. All participant centers must adopt the same technique to perform FA with the attempt to homogenize the procedure. Twenty-five milligrams of ICG powder is suspended in 10 ml of sterile water and administered intravenously through a peripheral vein and in small repeatable boluses of 2 ml in order to evaluate the intestinal microcirculation extemporaneously. The presence and pattern of arterial supply is tested and compared with that of healthy bowel. Proper clearance of the dye was also appraised to verify adequate venous drainage. Following the reversal of the underlying cause of the ischaemic injury, and after generous irrigation with warm saline, the involved bowel segment was further evaluated with FA after 10 min, regardless of the return of visible peristalsis. Routine postoperative clinical judgment will be considered sufficient to check bowel vitality. The need for a second-look surgery and delayed resections will be recorded. All centers could participate with a maximum of 3-4 members (co-authorship) Data will be recorded by a simple and brief online Case Report Form (CRF) on which upload also a photo/brief video of the FA, will be filled out by every participating center for each patient.

            "Background: Stroke is the 4th deadly disease in Taiwan, 2016. Long term disabilities, balance impairments and limitations of activities of daily living are common characteristics of stroke. Balance assessment and training play an important role in stroke rehabilitation. However, there are some limitations. Clinical assessments (functional scales) could not avoid some errors caused by subjective observations from different test givers; instrumental assessments (force plates, Biodex system) are complex to approach, not easy to use, and difficult to get. Balance training could not meet the expected effectiveness due to inconvenient transportations, forgotten home programs, and time limitation caused by huge amount of patients with insufficient therapists. Smartphones had been used for health promoting and sport training. The balance training related applications could be found at Google Play store, but clinically proved effective App and stroke-designed App has not yet existed. The balance rehabilitation of stroke sufferers will be benefited if there is an easy-use and effective App that supports balance assessment and personalized training by combining the convenience and powerfulness of smartphones. Purpose: The purposes of this study are: Year 1 Develop a smartphone-based application to assess and train static balance for stroke sufferers, and evaluate the feasibility of the application; Year 2 Develop a smartphone-based application to assess and train dynamic balance for stroke sufferers, and evaluate the feasibility of the application; Year 3 Build a static and dynamic balance performance standard by recruiting healthy subjects, then evaluate the training effects of the application on balance performance of stroke sufferers. Methods: Android smartphones will be used to analyze the balance performance by collecting acceleration and angular velocity data from the built-in sensors. Static balance assessment and training system will be developed in the first year. The system will assess balance ability by testing the performance under different standing conditions, then provide a training plan according to the assessment result. Dynamic balance assessment and training system will be developed in the second year. The system will execute limits of stability test to assess dynamic balance, then provide a training plan according to the assessment result. Validity and reliability will be tested in the first and second year, by comparing the smartphone assessment result with Berg balance scale, force plate, and Biodex balance system. In the third year, we will recruit healthy subjects to create a balance performance standard, then recruit chronic stroke subjects to evaluate the training effect of the App by comparing with traditional rehabilitation therapy. Expected Results & Contribution When the study is completed, several valuable contributions will be provided. These include (1) developing a smartphone application which can be used to assess and rehabilitate static and dynamic balance functions on stroke sufferers; (2) evaluating the feasibility and the training effects of the smartphone application, and providing evidence-based results for scientific paper publication; (3) clinically offering an easy-used and effective tool for clinicians and subjects with stroke to evaluate and improve balance performance."

The investigators propose to conduct a micro-randomized trial (MRT) to empirically optimize a smartphone-based just-in-time adaptive intervention (JITAI) that monitors risk and intervenes on lapses as needed. By evaluating the immediate, proximal effect of four theory-driven interventions on lapse behavior, the project will: (a) produce a scalable, finalized JITAI that has the greatest potential to show clear clinical impact in future trials; and (b) inform the development of more sophisticated theoretical models of adherence behavior more broadly. Therefore, this study has three goals. First the investigators aim to compare the effects of delivering any intervention to no intervention on the occurrence of lapse. Second, the investigators aim to compare the effects of specific theory-driven interventions to one another to determine which ones are best for preventing lapses. Within this second aim, the investigators also aim to examine other factors that may influence the effectiveness of interventions (e.g., time, location). Lastly, the investigators will use the data from this MRT to customize intervention delivery in future versions of this JITAI Patients will be recruited through various methods including advertisements in local media, targeted online advertising, advertisements in medical and minority communities, and direct mailers. All participants will receive a well-established 3-month online obesity treatment program, with 3 months of no-treatment follow-up. In conjunction, they will use a smartphone-based JITAI consisting of: 1) repeated daily surveys assess lapses and relevant triggers; 2) a machine learning algorithm that uses information from the surveys to determine real-time lapse risk; & 3) interventions to counter lapse risk. When an individual is at risk for lapsing she will be randomly assigned to no intervention, a generic risk alert, or one of 4 theory-driven interventions with interactive skills training. The outcome of interest will be the occurrence (or lack thereof) of dietary lapse, as measured both subjectively (i.e., reported by the participant in the daily surveys) and objectively (i.e., via wrist-based intake monitoring), in the hours following randomization initiated by heightened lapse risk."

            "The definitive treatment of disabling metatarsalgia requires surgery. In recent years, a percutaneous technique has been developed, the \"Distal Metatarsal Mini-invasive Osteotomy\" (DMMO). It consists of performing extra-articular osteotomies that are not osteosynthesized and maintained during the time of bone consolidation by a dressing and specific offloading footwear.The patient is encouraged to resume walking immediately after the procedure, as full plantar support is an integral part of the surgical concept. The goal is to actively modify the distribution of all metatarsal supports by the pressure exerted on the ground during walking and by tendon tensions, in order to reduce forefoot deformities. DMMO offers many advantages over traditional techniques, but it remains a painful forefoot surgery in the short term despite the systematic use of analgesics and the wearing of a dedicated therapeutic shoe. The study will seek to identify the predictive character of podobarometric parameters at walking (D+7 and D+30 post-op), between patients who will require a palliative solution versus those who will not (D+90)"

            "Health care professionals (HCPs) help an support patients living with type 1 diabetes (PWT1D) who need to achieve optimal blood glucose control in order to prevent short and long term complications of T1D. However, studies show that not all HCPs are aware of T1D management as most of them only see PWT1D occasionally. This makes it difficult for HCPs to remain aware of the particularities of the condition and stay up-to-date on rapidly evolving technologies and therapies available. Moreover, low confidence levels and the inaccessibility to continuing medical education on the specificities of new therapies and technologies might increase the failure of HCPs to propose the optimal treatment plan to their PWT1D. The SUPPORT online platform, that was first developed for PWT1D, was adjusted to suit the needs of HCPs (SUPPORT-Pro). The regularly updated bilingual (English and French) peer-reviewed content of SUPPORT, which covers the various elements that an individual with T1D needs to know to manage the disease and aims at making a better use of technologies and new therapies, is the first in its kind and is highly relevant for HCPs. The main objective of this study is to determine if the SUPPORT-Pro online training platform can increase HCPs' (dietitians, nurses, pharmacists, medical doctors) confidence level in treating individuals with T1D. This study is a non-randomized pre-post trial. We hypothesize that the training provided through the SUPPORT-Pro online platform will significantly increase HCPs' confidence level in treating individuals with T1D after 3 months when compared to their confidence level before the intervention."

            "Background: Over the last several years, there has been an increase in the popularity and availability of mobile digital technologies. Many recent studies have evaluated a range of mobile digital mental health interventions (DMHIs). Smartphone applications, remote monitoring, tracking devices, and wearable computers such as smartwatches and virtual reality headsets are being widely used for these studies. Besides that, psychometric scales are being used to help psychiatrists to improve treatment outcomes. The systematic administration of symptom rating scales and other assessment tools to help treatment decisions has been called measurement-based care (MBC) and it has shown good results in improving outcomes and time to response/remission of psychiatric diseases. As there is little data regarding MBC in Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD), the investigators decided to put technology and MBC together to study an easy and accessible way to improve the GAD usual treatment. Objectives: The aim of this study is to evaluate the benefit of digital interventions as an add-on tool to \"treatment-as-usual\" (TAU) in GAD patients. Methods: A twelve-weeks randomized clinical trial will be performed with 60 GAD patients. The control group will receive TAU, defined as 30-minutes online consultation with a trained psychiatrist, consisting in symptoms evaluation, general orientations about the disorder and use of medication. The consultations are going to occur biweekly. The digital intervention group (active group) will receive TAU, associated with two digital tools. The first one consists of psychoeducational videos to be seen between the sessions and the second one includes self-application of GAD-7 scale the day before the next scheduled consultation. All these digital interventions are going to be accessed in a mobile application, called \"+PSI\", that is already available in Apple Store and Google Play. The participants are going to be instructed to download the application on their mobile phones for free. The videos are going to be created especially for this project and will use animations and educational content, being of short duration (average 3 minutes). GAD-7 scale, and Hamilton Anxiety Scale (HAM-A) are going to be applied at baseline and at the end of the follow up by a blind rater. The investigators are also going to test the application tools usability using the System Usability Scale (SUS). Intermediate and follow-up evaluations will be performed to assess the speed and maintenance of improvement, respectively."

Compared to non-Hispanic children, Hispanic children have higher long-term disability and lower health related quality of life, even though differences are not present at hospital discharge. Rehabilitation decreases disability, but needs timely initiation, and long treatments in hospitals, community healthcare facilities and schools. Parents play a key role in their child's recovery. Hispanic parents face additional barriers to initiate and maintain outpatient treatments. They report knowledge gaps in TBI-education, community, and school support systems; language and health literacy barriers. The investigators developed, a bilingual bicultural theory-based program for Hispanic families consisting of Brain Injury Education and outpatient care Navigation (1st BIEN). It integrates in-person education enriched by video content delivered through mobile phones, with navigation during transitions to outpatient care and school return. The pilot established feasibility and acceptability of the program. This randomized control trial will determine efficacy to maintain long-term adherence to rehabilitation and reduce disability. It will enroll 150 parent-child dyads: children (6-17 y), with mild-complicated, moderate-severe TBI in 5 centers in Washington, Texas, Dallas, Utah and Oregon and their parents. Intervention group parents receive: One in-person education session, plus bi-weekly videos tailored to the child's TBI and therapies; and, 3-months of bilingual outpatient care navigation. Attention control parents receive one in person-education session, monthly well-child texts and usual institutional follow up care. Primary outcome is treatment adherence at 6 months post-discharge measured by percentage of follow-up appointments attended during the prescribed time at hospitals, and community care facilities. Secondary outcomes are functional status of the child using PROMIS parental report measures; and parental health literacy, self-efficacy, and mental health at 3, 6, and 12 months after discharge. Child's academic performance will be assessed using school records. The study evaluates a flexible and scalable intervention using mobile phones to aid transitions of care, improve treatment adherence and TBI outcomes. It addresses the needs of an understudied population and can serve as a model for TBI family centered care for at risk groups."

A 2016 randomized controlled trial found that nasally inhaled isopropyl alcohol achieved better nausea relief compared to placebo during a 10-minute period. In 2018, another randomized controlled trial showed that nasally inhaled isopropyl alcohol with or without oral ondansetron provided greater relief for nausea than oral ondansetron alone. QUESTION In electronic dance music festival attendees, who present with nausea to the medical team, how does inhaled isopropyl alcohol compare with inhaled sterile saline (placebo) for self-reported nausea 10-minutes post-intervention? METHODS Canadian electronic dance music festival attendees who present with nausea to the medical team, will be recruited until sample size reaches at least 70. Inclusion criteria will be festival attendees aged 18+ with a complaint of nausea. Exclusion criteria will include known allergy to isopropyl alcohol, inability to inhale through the nares, inability to report level of nausea, or already have taken an anti-nauseant. After obtaining consent, participants will be randomized into two study arms. Arm 1 will nasally inhale an isopropyl alcohol pad with 10 deep inhalations (intervention). Arm 2 will nasally inhale a sterile saline pad with 10 deep inhalations (placebo). The pad must be within 2cm from the nares to ensure delivery. According to a study in 2002, isopropyl alcohol pad inhalation, dosed at 3 inhalations every 5 minutes for 3 doses, was not significantly different than standard treatment for relief of nausea. 10 inhalations exceeds the 9-dose total reported in the paper, and a one-time bolus dose of 10 inhalations, for the population and festival context, is more feasible in terms of patient compliance and patient flow. After randomization, participants will rate their nausea on a numeric response scale (0 to 10, where 0 is no nausea and 10 is \"worst nausea imaginable\"). 10-minutes post-inhalation (isopropyl alcohol or placebo), participants will be asked to rate their nausea again. The primary outcome is self-reported nausea scores 10-minutes post-intervention. The secondary outcome is the presence or absence of any vomiting spells 10-minutes post-intervention, as well as the presence or absence of rescue-medication needed 10-minutes post-intervention."

            "The aim of this phase II, randomized, double-blind clinical trial is to evaluate the effect of home-based transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) in patients with treatment-resistant depression. Major depressive disorder is defined by depressed mood and/or loss of interest in activities, during most of the day, nearly every day, for at least two weeks. It is usually accompanied by other symptoms, such as fatigue, sleep disturbances, thoughts of guilt, suicidal ideation, appetite alterations, difficulty to focus and physical agitation or retardation. It is estimated that its worldwide prevalence is 5%, affecting 280-300 million people. A third of patients with depression will develop treatment resistant depression, where symptoms fail to remit after at least two trials of antidepressants. Beyond psychotropics, another treatment option is neuromodulation, where excitatory or inhibitory signals are delivered to the brain, in order to modulate cortical excitability. The tDCS is a non-invasive brain stimulation method that applies a low intensity direct current (1-2mA) directed to the scalp via the cathode and anode electrodes. The current reaches the cortex, facilitating hyperpolarization or depolarization of the axonal membrane potential. Evidence has shown that this method is presented as a technique able to alter cortical and subcortical neural networks. This technique has been used to treat psychiatric disorders such as depression, bipolar affective disorder, panic, hallucinations, obsessive compulsive disorder, schizophrenia, withdrawal, rehabilitation after stroke and pain syndromes such as neuropathic pain, migraine and fibromyalgia. It has a low cost and less side effects than psychotropic medications. In order to be effective, daily repeated sessions of 20-40 minutes are necessary. When applied in a hospital setting, this frequency of sessions can limit its appliance, especially for depressed patients, whose symptoms include fatigue and loss of interest in activities. Furthermore, transportation costs, frequent absences from work and other activities and overload of the healthcare system would also limit its use. Home based devices are portable and easily operated. Thus, it is possible for patients to administer themselves the treatment, in their own home, everyday. Therefore, the aim of this study is to evaluate the effect of home-based tDCS in treatment resistant depression patients in long-term treatment."

In Denmark, 20-30 % have experienced dizziness/vertigo to a degree that has led to disability, sick leave, or medical contact(1). In the United States, dizziness is estimated to account for partly 2.6-4.4 million visits to emergency departments (EDs) each year, partly 4 % of main symptoms in patients admitted to EDs (2). In Germany, the estimated prevalence of dizziness is 20-30 % with an annual incidence about 11 % (3). Terminology and definition: Dizziness or vertigo is not a disease itself but rather a symptom of various underlying disorders. Thus, vestibular, neurological, cardiovascular, metabolic, and psychiatric diseases may be associated with dizziness/vertigo as well as medical side effects. Patients (and professionals) often use the two terms dizziness and vertigo synonymously, which may cause some confusion in the choice of diagnostics. Vertigo is characteristic for vestibular disorders and is defined as sensation of self-motion when no self-motion occurs, or sensation of distorted self-motion during an otherwise normal head movement, whereas dizziness is a feeling of more general unsteadiness. 1. Is implementation of HINTS and v-HIT in an ED able to reduce the number of undiagnosed and misdiagnosed cases of acute onset vertigo as well as diagnostic delay ? 2.

            "Mal de D\u00e9barquement Syndrome (MdDS) is an under-recognized balance disorder, which is manifested by persistent false sensations of oscillatory self-motion (rocking/swaying) and/or pulling in a specific direction (gravitational pull). Patients with MdDS typically experience additional presumably secondary symptoms, such as heightened sensitivity to visual motion (visually induced dizziness, VID), physical motion (motion sickness, MS), and other debilitating physical, cognitive, or affective problems. MdDS was previously considered intractable, and only recently was a breakthrough made in the clinical laboratory with an introduction of a visual-vestibular therapy protocol, yielding a significant long-term improvement of symptoms, including complete remission, in about 50% of patients. However, the approach is limited in several ways. Firstly, there is a practical limitation in implementing the treatment protocol, which requires a specialized set-up for visual stimulation in a dedicated room. This research will address this limitation by testing the utility of virtual reality technology to implement the treatment protocol. Secondly, patients often retain residual symptoms of VID and MS susceptibility, which often act as a trigger for the recurrence of MdDS. This limitation will be addressed by supplementing the original approach with an additional treatment focusing on VID or MS susceptibility. Thirdly, although the original protocol focused on reducing rocking/swaying sensations, gravitational pull often co-occurs with such sensations, and some experience only that motion sensation. This limitation will be addressed by modifying the original protocol. Two hundred patients with MdDS will be recruited for the study. Bias will be controlled by randomized group assignment and the use of placebo treatments. Patients will be treated for 1-2 hours a day for 5 days. Patients will be followed for up to 6 months. The proposed study will facilitate improved outcomes for MdDS by broadening its treatment options."

The primary goal of this study is to evaluate the feasibility of the Prostate Cancer Genius App in a 30-day pilot randomized control trial compared to an existing app developed by the U.S. Department of Health & Human Services (Prevention Taskforce App). African American men from Oklahoma, aged between 55 and 69 (N = 80), eligible for the PSA test will be randomly assigned 1:1 to receive either app. Three dimensions of app feasibility will be assessed: (1) preliminary efficacy, evaluated via post-intervention differences in prostate cancer knowledge, (2) app engagement and accessibility, measured via self-report questionnaires, and (3) app acceptability, explored via semi-structured qualitative interviews. Finally, the investigative team will explore post-intervention PSA screening rates and identify predictors of screening/not screening across both arms. The successful demonstration of feasibility for the Prostate Cancer Genius App within Oklahoma will support expanding this intervention to African Americans nationwide."

            "Assessing Malleability of Spatial Abilities in Down Syndrome",
            "Based on available literature and our own preliminary research, the researchers have concluded that persons with Down syndrome (DS) exhibit difficulties in utilizing the specific spatial abilities of mental rotation and perspective taking and performing complex spatial tasks such as wayfinding and environmental learning. A weakness in spatial abilities may have many direct applications to daily life, ranging from activities such as tying shoes to using hand tools and navigating the environment. Spatial abilities also serve as a cognitive foundation for many other complex skills such as solving mathematical problems and using spatial language for giving and receiving directions. Moreover, spatial abilities are used in a variety of specialty jobs such as grocery stocking, packaging, and assembling, which are among the most commonly reported jobs for adults with DS. Hence, a new focus on spatial ability and its modifiability in persons with DS is clearly warranted. The primary goal of the research proposed in this application is to evaluate the malleability of mental rotation and perspective taking in people with DS through providing intentional experience with numerous spatial activities. Two groups of participants will be tested over the course of the project: adolescents and young adults with DS and typically developing (TD) children. Following an initial evaluation of performance on the two abilities, participants will receive up to eight sessions of spatial activity experience utilizing puzzle construction, block building, and computer search tasks. Following the experience sessions, spatial abilities of participants will be re-evaluated. These data will be used to investigate two specific aims. First, the researchers investigate whether spatial abilities of persons with DS can be modified by experience with spatial activities. Second, the researchers investigate whether the degree of modification observed for persons with DS can reduce performance differences between them and TD children. The researchers also consider whether performance on the PPVT, Raven's matrices, and Chronological Age are associated with any benefits from spatial ability experience."

Currently, treatments for pain and anxiety around the time of surgery include opioids and benzodiazepines, which can have severe side effects and can be ineffective. Interventions combining virtual reality with olfactory stimuli are a promising alternative to opioids and benzodiazepines in the treatment of pain and anxiety around the time of surgery.

Patients who meet study inclusion criteria and are undergoing cardiothoracic surgery may participate in this study. Patients have an equal being assigned to undergo the virtual reality and olfactory stimuli intervention or continue getting usual medical care with their doctor. If the patient is assigned to receive the virtual reality and olfactory stimuli intervention, the first therapy session will take place approximately two to four weeks before surgery. This will involve wearing a virtual reality headset and scented necklace for approximately 10 minutes. The second session will occur 90 minutes before the surgery. Additionally, for each day the patient recovers in the hospital after surgery, the patient will receive one session in the afternoon.

            "New Brunswick has an aging population with Canada's highest rate of sleeping pill use. The rate of long-term (chronic) use among NB seniors is 25%, well in excess of the Canadian average of 10%. The rate of use is higher in women and increases with age, as do risks for serious harms. Sleeping pills risks are substantial and costly, especially to seniors. Research does not support their long-term use. Risk for falls causing injuries, including hip fractures, is a leading concern. They impair mental and physical functioning resulting in a loss of independence and cause impaired driving and a higher rate of serious crashes. The rate of near-fatal and fatal overdoses from mixing sleeping pills with other drugs is on the rise. Stopping treatment can be difficult due to physical dependence and withdrawal symptoms. Cognitive behavioural therapy for insomnia (CBTi) is recommended as the first-line treatment of chronic insomnia. Sleeping pills are only to be considered when CBTi fails. However, these recommendations are not reflected in primary care practice. Internationally, many educational interventions targeting prescribers have been tried, yet have failed to reduce sleeping pill use. However, a 12-page pamphlet (EMPOWER) given directly to seniors in a clinical trial was associated with a large reduction in sleeping pill use. Using a similarly persuasive approach, Sleepwell (mysleepwell.ca) was developed to reduce the use of sleeping pills and facilitate CBTi access and use. Sleepwell differs from EMPOWER by providing specific information and recommendations regarding CBTi in addition to guidance on how to stop sleeping pills. This study will evaluate the effectiveness of direct-to-patient interventions on long-term sleeping pill use."

After initial diagnosis, restaging appointments can bring back additional fear, sadness, and anxiety. Music listening interventions can alleviate stress associated with cancer diagnosis by improving patients' ability to cope with the mental and emotional strain that accompanies their disease. Yet, current music listening interventions lack personalization and moment-to-moment adjustments that accompany traditional music therapy in the hands of a seasoned professional. Rubato Life\u2122 (RL) application uses a proprietary algorithm for music selection that utilizes machine-learning and deep neural network to select music that reduces stress as measured by heart rate variability in real time, offering improved personalization of stress-reducing music. We hypothesize that using personalized musical playlists, through RL, will improve stress and anxiety outcomes for patients undergoing cancer restaging more than participant-selected music. This 3-week longitudinal study will include 200 patients from St. Elizabeth's Medical Center who have scheduled appointments for cancer restaging. Participants will be randomized into one of two groups: a) an intervention group, in which patients will listen to music using Rubato Life app, and b) a control group, in which patients listen to music of their own choice that they believe to be stress reducing. Patients in both groups will be asked to listen to at least 45 minutes per day, for a period of 2 weeks coming up to their scheduled restaging appointment (or at least 12 total hours of listening), and for one hour immediately after the appointment. Patients in the Intervention group will wear smartwatches to monitor heart rate variability throughout the study. Patients will be asked to complete assessments of anxiety (STAI-S) prior to randomization, on the day of their restaging, and following one hour of post-restaging music listening."

Investigators propose to conduct multimodal real-time assessment of behavioral, psychosocial, and contextual characteristics to uncover lapse phenotypes (i.e., meaningful clusters of lapse behaviors, such as lapsing via overeating vs. lapsing via eating an off-plan food). Using wearable sensors and a smartphone-based assessment platform, this research will identify latent characteristics underlying different phenotypes of dietary lapses reported by individuals who are participating in an online BOT. This study will also evaluate how these emerging lapse phenotypes vary over time, between individuals, and within individuals. Such information will ultimately help the field understand how best to reduce lapses in future treatments (e.g., how much to personalize future interventions for lapse vs. generalizability of lapse phenotypes across individuals). Therefore, this study has three goals. First, investigators aim to establish lapse phenotypes by identifying clusters of behavioral, psychosocial, contextual and individual-level factors (e.g., sex, race) that differentiate lapse behaviors during weight loss and maintenance. Second, the investigators aim to test the association of lapse phenotypes with energy intake and weight change during weight loss and maintenance to determine which lapse phenotypes have the greatest impact on BOT outcomes (e.g. personal, environmental, and behavioral factors). Lastly, investigators aim to evaluate individual variability in the occurrence of lapse phenotypes during weight loss and maintenance to determine the generalizability of lapse phenotypes across individuals. Participants will be recruited through various methods including advertisements in local media, targeted online advertising, advertisements in medical and minority communities, and direct mailers.

However, this is expensive, involves a considerable workload and is quite complex. Additionally, the wait time from when the patient was referred for PSG to when it is done can take up to 5-6 months. Simpler screening tools have therefore been developed, such as questionnaires. The questionnaires are subjective tools completed by the parents based on the observation of the child's sleep, behavioral problems, etc. These questionnaires have shown usefulness in sorting out patients to be referred to a sleep specialist, an Oto-Rhino-Laryngologist (ENT) or an orthodontist before performing a PSG in view of the difficulty of access to it. The Pediatric Sleep Questionnaire (PSQ) is a tool that was developed by Chervin and his colleagues to screen children with OSAS. This questionnaire is a reliable and scientifically validated tool. In addition, the PSQ is the most accurate questionnaire from a screening point of view. However, the American Academy of Pediatric Dentistry (AAPD) considers that the questionnaires, among others, the PSQ, are not sensitive enough to detect OSAS in a child. They offer an anamnesis as well as a clinical examination to be carried out in addition to the few questions taken from the PSQ that they consider useful for screening patients at risk. The investigators can therefore ask themselves the following question: \"Is the PSQ sufficient on its own or do the investigators obtain better results when the investigators carry out a complete anamnesis as well as a clinical examination? \""

However comprehensive descriptive data are still lacking regarding PICS in pediatrics (PICS-p). The aim of this study is to describe (in nature and frequency) the alterations in health defined by the WHO of children who have passed through the PICU and constitute a possible PICS-p. In order to do this, we will perform a prospective cohort study in Robert-Debr\u00e9 University Hospital including the PICU. We will include children with an unplanned hospitalization for more than 72 hours for acute complication of sickle cell disease (such as acute chest syndrome or vaso-occlusive crisis), acute asthma or sepsis and aged from 3 to 17 years. We plan to include 40 patients admitted to the PICU as well as 40 controls admitted to the general pediatrics unit or the pneumology unit without PICU admission, matched on diagnosis, age range and period. The primary endpoint will be the prevalence of children that had been admitted to PICU and reporting cognitive, psychological, physical and social impairments measured by questionnaire and medical record data collection on the day before discharge and at the routine post-hospitalization visit. Secondary objectives will be to study the risk factors for PICS-p, to compare alterations in cognitive, psychological, physical and social domains in children with the same diagnosis and age not admitted to the PICU during their hospitalization. In order to this, we will measure the association with the PICU stay characteristics, parental experience and social characteristics of families. We will also report the prevalence of children not admitted in intensive care and reporting cognitive, psychological, physical and social impairments measured by questionnaire and medical record data collection on the day before discharge and at the routine post-hospitalization visit.

Muscle wasting is a strong predictor of frailty and reduced survival in HF patients. Currently, standard treatments for slowing muscle loss in patients with HF are not available. The main intervention remains various types of physical activity programs. Telemonitoring is a promising strategy for improving heart failure outcomes by making it possible to monitor patients remotely. There are numerous examples of home-based exercise programs administered through telehealth services that have been beneficial for maintaining physical activity levels. These results highlight the potential utility of telehealth services for combatting sedentarism and muscle wasting among epidemic and post-epidemic phases. Objective\uff1a The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of a multi-component physical activity program based on home telemonitoring on patients with heart failure and muscle wasting. Methods\uff1a This study used an quasi-experimental study, two-group repeated measurement design.

Although significant progress has been made in understanding the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying the onset and progression of AS, there is no medical treatment to slow or prevent its progression. The only treatment available is Aortic Valve Replacement (AVR) performed by surgery or by catheterization (TAVI). Once a diagnosis has been made and the decision to treat these patients has been taken, the procedure (AVR or TAVI) must be performed rapidly given the poor prognosis of the disease without treatment. Studies have shown that on the waiting list, the probability of death and hospitalisation for heart failure increases with time. This delay could also reduce the effectiveness of TAVI, thus affecting the performance of the healthcare system.

According to the guidelines, a copious fluid intake to maintain a urine volume of at least 2.0 to 2.5 L/24 h is recommended for most kidney stone formers. Patients often find it difficult to follow the recommendations in fluid intake, which leads to stone recurrence. Therefore, there is a need to improve patient compliance and adherence to following the instructions on keeping water balance. For this purpose we developed a mixed educational program including two parts. The first is the mobile application called \"StoneMD: Kidney Stones\". The second is the \"School for Patients\" with kidney stones, which is responsible for the stone clinic effect."

Multiple prediction models for estimating the risk of VTE have been developed. However, many models have not been externally validated. The aim of this study is to perform a comprehensive external validation of pre-existing prediction models for predicting the risk of in-hospital VTE in critically ill patients. In case current risk assessment models fail, the investigators aim to additionally develop and internally validate a new risk prediction model. Methods: During the first phase of the study the investigators will perform external validation of existing prediction models. The performance, discrimination, calibration and clinical usefulness of the models will be evaluated. In the second phase of the study, in case performance of current risk assessment models is deemed insufficient for clinical application, the investigators will develop a model for predicting the risk of in-hospital VTE in critically ill patients. A multivariable prediction model will be constructed using a combination of predefined candidate predictors. This model will be internally validated and performance will be compared with performance of existing VTE risk prediction models. Dissemination: This protocol will be published online. This study will be reported according to the Transparent reporting of a multivariable prediction model for individual prognosis or diagnosis (TRIPOD) statement and this study will be submitted to a peer-reviewed journal for publication."

            "Experiences such as hospitalization, medical or surgical procedures are stressful, complex and threatening, especially for children and their families. Among the first crisis symptoms that children are faced with are illness, hospitalization and surgery anxiety. There is a direct relationship between the fear and anxiety experienced by children and their parents during the pre-operative processes. Therefore, ensuring not only the psychological but also physiological preparation of both the children and their parents before the surgery is of great importance. In the hospital, applying distraction methods appropriate for the age period of children and conveying procedural information to them simultaneously are difficult and challenging. In such situations, in clinical settings, virtual reality technology can be used at any time and place without requiring extra workforce to eliminate or reduce children's fear and anxiety. Virtual reality applications, as a distracting therapeutic method, are a fun, calming, safe, accessible, effective and acceptable intervention that can be used for the management of acute pain, fear and anxiety in pediatric patients. Such applications can affect children visually, aurally and contextually. Because they are different from common distraction methods used by children such as reading books, playing with toys, watching television or movies, playing a two-dimensional video game or game console. Virtual reality (VR) is used to distract children's attention to reduce fear and anxiety before surgery. A VR tour of the operating theater can provide a realistic experience for children. The aim in this study was to investigate the effect of an actual operating theater tour which is watched by children aged 6-12 years wearing a 3D virtual headset on their fear and anxiety."

SAMPLES: two clinical samples (1. outpatients from three psychotherapeutic centers; two university clinics and a family mental health clinic and 2. self-reported clinical) and two non-clinical (1. university students; and 2. general community) samples. Students and community nonstudent participants who reported receiving psychological or psychiatric treatment (exclusion criterion) were excluded from the non-clinical sample and classified as self-reported clinical. DATA COLLECTION: In the clinical sample, data is collected at one point if the patient is undergoing treatment and at four points (at baseline (i.e. before the first session), at 2, 5 and 8-weeks) if the patient is recruited before attending the first psychotherapy session. Participants complete a paper questionnaire in the waiting room of one of the clinics. Participants from the second university outpatient clinic and a family mental health clinic complete a digital version. At baseline, participants are presented with the CORE-OM and the Outcome Questionnaire (OQ-45). At each follow-up point, they are presented with the CORE-OM plus mental health service evaluation items. In the student and community samples, data is collected at two time points (i.e. baseline and retest). At baseline, participants are presented with the CORE-OM and OQ-45. After two weeks (i.e. retest) participants are contacted via email and presented with the CORE-OM. The application modality in the non-clinical samples is mixed: students and general community participants complete paper or digital versions of the questionnaire in the classroom or community, respectively. The digital version of the questionnaire can be accessed by clicking a Uniform Resource Locator embedded in an email/message, or by scanning a Quick Response (QR) code with a smartphone. RECRUITMENT: The clinical sample is recruited at two university outpatient clinics and a family mental health clinic of Santiago, Chile which provide services to patients of low to medium income. Patients in one of the university clinics are approached in the waiting area, and those meeting inclusion criteria, and willing to participate, fill out an informed consent before responding the questionnaire. Patients from the second university clinic/family mental health clinic are referred when booking their first appointment and contacted via email by a research team member.

Students agreeing to participate fill out an informed consent form before completing paper/digital versions of the questionnaire. The general community sample is recruited using a convenience sampling method. As in other samples, participants sign an informed consent before answering the questionnaire. ANALYSES: internal consistency, test-retest stability, convergent validity and discrimination. Clinical cut-off values will be calculated by domain and sex between the clinical and non-clinical samples and sensitivity to change will be assessed using data from the subsample of outpatients who respond an online questionnaire before their first session and at one follow up point."

Optical coherent tomography (OCT) technology is a fast, non-invasive, non-radioactive, and label-free imaging method. This technology generates real-time images of living tissue by detecting the variations in the refractive indexes of various components in soft tissues. Recently, there is a breakthrough progress that the newly designed ultrahigh resolution OCT can provide in vivo cellular resolution similar to histopathological sections in the high magnification. In our previous clinical trial \"Early feasibility study: application of OCT imaging in dermatology\" (approved by IRB of MacKay Memorial Hospital, no. 17CT062Be), it showed characteristic features of different skin inflammatory diseases and tumors can be distinguished successfully in tomograms. There were no adverse event or serious adverse event in this trial. Artificial intelligence technologies have been used widely in the image analysis in recent years. Hence, we aim to collect OCT tomograms of common skin inflammatory diseases, skin tumors, and pigmented diseases, and compare with normal skin for machine learning. We expect the integration of tomograms with deep learning artificial intelligence may assist identifying histological features in these images and provide new alternative way for non-invasive diagnosis in dermatology."

            "The majority of opioid users meet criteria for anxiety and depressive disorders, but most substance use disorder treatment programs do not offer treatment for co-occurring mental health problems. Anxiety and depression may also be directly linked to opioid use itself. Although treatments have been developed for anxiety and depressive symptoms for opioid users within face-to-face settings, few treatment facilities offer these in-person interventions due to their high cost and time burden. Given the deficits in research on treatments for anxiety and depression among those with opioid use disorder, the current research will examine the efficacy of a digital intervention designed to treat anxiety and depressive symptoms by augmenting the state of the science medication-based opioid use disorder treatment. Over the course of the proposed study, the research team will design and test the feasibility and acceptability of a standalone mobile intervention designed to treat persons receiving medication treatment for opioid use disorder. Participants receiving medication treatment for opioid use disorder will be randomized to receive a digital intervention to treat anxiety and depression or care as usual for a total of four weeks. The overarching goal of the proposed work is to test the feasibility and acceptability of the proposed mobile intervention. The Investigators will also explore the preliminary efficacy by examining reductions in anxiety and depressive symptoms and opioid cravings and use. This work could lead to a low-cost scalable solution to augment gold-standard treatment as usual in opioid use disorder by decreasing levels of comorbidity of anxiety and depressive disorders, thereby ultimately improving the outcomes of opioid use disorder itself."

            "Human beings are able to produce precise and smooth movements despite varying demands thank to the nervous system plasticity. Primastic exposure is a method that allows to easily study these sensorimotor plasticity processes in a laboratory context. In a typical protocol, participants wear prismatic goggles that induce a lateral deviation of the visual field while performing a goal directed motor task (e.g. pointing). During the first trials, participants make errors in the direction of the deviation and correct them trial-by-trial. Finally, participants go back to baseline performances after a few dozen of trials. Upon goggles removal, participants make mistakes toward the direction opposition to the initial prismatic deviation. These after-effects reflect adaptive processes that occurred to counteract the perturbation. The way that these after-effects can be transferred to other situations which have not been exposed to the prismatic perturbation bring crucial information about the nature of the processes involved. Additionally, these transfer properties might be of great interest in the field of neuro rehabilitation. In fact, the purpose of therapeutic strategies is to induce compensations that can be transferred to daily life situations. In previous studies, the investigator showed that expertise on the exposed had a notable influence on transfer properties. However, these studies did not allow to identify the cerebral regions involved in transfer. The cerebellum is described as a major area implied during motor adaptation and the occurrence of after-effects, while the primary motor cortex might play a crucial role in the formation of motor memory. As such, these two regions are likely to be involved in transfer properties. The objective of this project is to identify the roles of the cerebellum and the primary motor cortex in the transfer of visuomotor compensations acquired during prism exposure to task that has not been practiced under the perturbation. To do so, the investigator will use transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) which is a non-painful and non-invasive functional brain stimulation method. Several groups will be constituted to test if stimulation (inhibitory and excitatory) of the cerebellum or the primary motor on the transfer of prism acquired compensations to a non-exposed task. More precisely, the investigator aim to study the influence of different stimulation modalities (cerebellum vs MA, inhibitory vs excitatory vs sham) on the error reduction during prism exposure, on the amount of after-effects and on the amount on transfer to the non-exposed task. On a fundamental level, this project will allow a better understanding of the sensorimotor plasticity processes involved to counteract a perturbation and about mechanisms underlying transfer properties. Future results would allows to shed light on the conditions necessary to give rise to transfer as well as the implied brain regions. On longer-term these results will be used to optimize rehabitation strategies in motor function recovery in order to favour the transfer of acquired compensations to daily life situations."

            "COPD is a condition which affects over 3 million people in the UK. It causes chronic symptoms including breathlessness and cough, limitations in exercise tolerance and acute exacerbations of COPD (AECOPD) which often lead to hospital admission. Current treatment for COPD includes inhaled medication and exercise programmes called Pulmonary Rehabilitation(PR) to improve exercise tolerance and resilience to AECOPD. Currently NHS respiratory services are struggling to provide support to patients with COPD, a recent-report highlighted that 75% of people with COPD are not receiving basic care. There is an increasing need therefore to improve the provision of PR and to support patients to self-manage their condition effectively, this requires new approaches and pathways of care. My mhealth Limited MMH is a UK based digital healthcare company established in 2011, specialising in the development of digital solutions for the management of long-term conditions. Evidence based, UKCA classified, and highly secure the company has developed a suite of solutions NHS approved and widely used, MHRA registered and is working towards NICE accreditation to manage patients with asthma, COPD, diabetes, and heart disease. myCOPD is a digital self-management application (app)therapeutic, developed by MMH, that supports all elements of managing COPD by creating a supported self-help environment, and in turn reduce medical visits, and hospital admissions and re-admissions. myCOPD allows for key aspects of disease management, such as PR, to be provided remotely, based on a person's self-assessment. Furthermore, it can help people with COPD manage their condition at home, or anywhere away from a clinical setting. Successful implementation of myCOPD provides an opportunity to build capacity in primary and secondary care, and community teams where a blended approach with traditional PR and myCOPD is used. Studies have shown myCOPD is able to deliver similar improvements in symptoms and exercise tolerance compared to PR exercise-classes and helps patients admitted to hospital recover more quickly at home. myCOPD is widely deployed across the NHS and is being used by patients in different areas of the UK- but to enable NICE approval and re-imbursement across all the NHS, evidence for the health-economic benefits of its use is required. With funding from SBRI Phase 3 grant, this project will explore the implementation of myCOPD by NHS respiratory services in two regions with diverse populations and challenges. In Bristol (Setting 1) the investigators will assess the value of using myCOPD in the COPD discharge care bundle for patients admitted to hospital with AECOPD, and its ability to help accelerate recovery, and prevent unscheduled care visits and re-admissions. Data collected from a pilot will be used to support the analysis. Whilst in Cornwall (Setting 2) the investigators will work with local services to provide 'digitally-supported PR' to isolated communities and increase the service capacity, completion rates and access to specialist support for self-management. A formal assessment will provide vital evidence for the value of myCOPD in the NHS and enable us to develop a business case for its national adoption and use, which will ultimately transform outcomes for people with this common and complex condition."

In the last few years, many studies have been conducted to facilitate pediatric patients against painful or frightening medical procedures. For uncomfortable procedures, distracting the child's attention is seen as the most important point. VR technology has been used for procedures such as burn cases, tooth extraction, intramuscular injection, intravenous cannula, lumbar puncture, and the results of the research have been found to be satisfactory. Using VR glasses alone or in combination with standard care is effective in reducing pain and anxiety. So far, there is no study in the literature on distraction with VR during inhaler treatment in pediatric patients. Children cannot receive inhaler treatment efficiently due to reasons such as restlessness, crying, and pulling the mask during inhaler treatment, and their hospital stay is prolonged. In this study, the investigators planned to compare the patients who received inhaler treatment with VR glasses with the patients who received treatment without the aid of any device in terms of treatment compliance. Thus, the investigators aimed to make the inhaler treatment more comfortable with VR technology."

            "The current study is intended to investigate the effectiveness of the Social-Emotional Prevention Program enhanced version (SEP+) for increasing preschoolers' social-emotional competencies and reducing their risk for behavior problems. Hypotheses for the current study are put forward for child- and parent-related outcomes. First, for the SEP+ effects for child-related outcomes, the investigators expect that: 1) intervention group children will be rated significantly higher on measures of social-emotional competencies (social skills and positive emotion regulation strategies (ER)) compared to children from the wait-list control group (primary outcomes); and 2) children assigned to the intervention will be rated significantly lower on externalizing, as well as internalizing problems (primary outcomes). In addition, for parent-related outcomes the hypotheses are: 1) intervention group parents will report significantly more positive parenting practices, and coparenting support, as well as significantly fewer negative parenting practices, coparenting undermining, and parenting stress compared to control group parents (secondary outcomes); and 2) intervention group parents will report significantly more positive coping strategies with children's negative emotions and adaptive ER strategies, as well as fewer negative coping strategies with children's negative emotions and less maladaptive ER strategies in comparison with control group parents (secondary outcomes). Additionally, the investigators aim to test potential intervention mechanisms. First, in the case of child-related outcomes, it is expected that children's use of adaptive ER strategies will mediate the intervention's effect on externalizing/internalizing problems; in a similar vein, it is hypothesized that improved social skills will mediate the intervention's effect on children's externalizing/internalizing problems. Furthermore, moderator effects of gender on adaptive emotion regulation strategies and externalizing problems will be tested. For the parenting intervention, it is expected that program's effect on positive parenting practices and stress will be mediated by the use of positive coping strategies, parental ER and coparenting support. Also, coparenting undermining and parental reported adverse events are hypothesized to moderate the intervention's effectiveness on parenting practices, parental stress, and parent ER/coping."

The World Health Organization classified the COVID-19 outbreak as an \"international public health emergency\" on January 30 and declared a global epidemic (pandemic) on March 11, 2020, due to the rapid spread of the virus all over the world. speed in the number of cases and deaths. Covidien-19 first cases were reported in Turkey on 10 March 2020 and the number of cases has risen steadily. The total number of COVID-19 cases worldwide on 31.01.2021; It was reported to be 101,917,147 and the total number of deaths was 2,205,515 (https://covid19.who.int/). Considering that the number of cases is constantly increasing, it is obvious that hospitals will not meet the entire epidemic burden. During this period, home care has emerged as an alternative way to effectively alleviate the epidemic burden. Home healthcare during the COVID-19 pandemic; Four roles have stood out: home diagnosis, follow-up, treatment, and care. Protective measures for home isolation of Covid-19 patients are the current method used to prevent the spread of cases. Possible or definite cases that do not have an indication for hospitalization, have a mild clinic and do not accompany severe chronic disease that may lead to a severe course of covid-19 are followed at home until their symptoms improve. In addition, patients who are hospitalized and meet discharge criteria can complete their recovery processes at home. Isolation is terminated on the 14th day at the earliest following the improvement of symptoms in patients who are followed at home. Reducing the contact of people, isolating certain and suspicious cases and effective use of personal protective equipment play an important role in combating the epidemic. It is thought that the training that COVID-19 cases to be followed up and treated at home will be effective in drug compliance, symptom management and quality of life will be effective in the management of the disease. 1251 / 5000 \u00c7eviri sonu\u00e7lar\u0131 The universe of the research will be composed of people who apply to Zonguldak Atat\u00fcrk State Hospital Emergency Service and Covid-19 Polyclinics. .

This is problematic as mothers in Manitoba must wait 12-18 months for therapeutic services. Children exposed to maternal mental illness in the first few years of life are at risk of negative lifelong adverse effects. Thus, the investigators of this project created and have tested The Building Emotion Awareness and Mental health (BEAM) program, which is an app-based mental health and parenting program for mothers of young children who are experiencing depression and/or anxiety. BEAM is now ready to be tested in partnership with an established community agency. This partnership will enable counsellors to provide expert-led mental health treatment to supplement and expand upon existing mental health services and will enable an established agency to address widespread unmet family mental health needs through the provision of mobile health (mHealth) content, training, and consultation. A two-arm pilot randomized controlled trial (RCT) with repeated measures will be used to evaluate the BEAM program compared to MoodMission (an evidence-based mHealth program) which will be the standard of care. Outcomes will be assessed to determine the effects of the BEAM program on reducing maternal mental health symptoms among a sample of 80 mothers who self-report moderate-to-severe symptoms of depression and/or anxiety (on the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 and the Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7, respectively), meet criteria for a current major depressive episode and/or anxiety disorder (as determined on the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview) and have a child between the ages of 6 to 18 months old."

            "During the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, stay-at-home isolation as a precaution to alleviate the disease has affected the physical and mental well-being of individuals. University students spent time in front of the screen with online education and developed a sedentary lifestyle during the academic term. In this process, musculoskeletal disorders increased more in university students due to the increase in the use of laptop or computer, smartphone, and social media. The COVID-19 pandemic has caused psychological disorders as well as physical health problems. General population studies have shown that all forms of depression, anxiety, stress, sleep problems, and psychological distress are highly increased during this period. In a study conducted in Turkey, it was reported that students' negative well-being, anxiety, and physical inactivity significantly affected perceived stress during the COVID-19 pandemic, and students' mental health was at high risk. It has been stated that providing mental health supportive systems in students and encouraging physical activity regularly can reduce perceived stress levels. On the other hand, psychological interventions via video conferencing platforms have been proposed to promote mental health due to the limited and delayed face-to-face healthcare as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. It has been stated that the use of telemedicine or e-health applications together with body-mind approaches such as yoga, tai chi, qigong may be beneficial in order to encourage physical activity and protect mental health in this critical period. Basic Body Awareness Therapy (BBAT), which is among the body-mind approaches, is also frequently used in the rehabilitation of patients with psychiatric disorders, pain, and chronic musculoskeletal system problems. Therefore, the aim of this study is to evaluate the effect of BBAT on musculoskeletal disorders and psychological symptoms in university students who participated in the hybrid (online + face-to-face) education program during the COVID-19 pandemic. The importance of this study is that it is the first study on physical and psychological symptoms of BBAT in university students."

Mobile health (mHealth) interventions can be effective tools to promote physical activity and reduce sedentary behavior. Promising results have been obtained by using gamification techniques as behavior change strategies, especially when they were tailored toward an individual's preferences and goals; yet, it remains unclear how goals could be personalized to effectively promote health behaviors. Objective: In this study, the investigators aim to evaluate the impact of personalized goal setting in the context of gamified mHealth interventions. The investigators hypothesize that interventions suggesting health goals that are tailored based on end users' (self-reported) current and desired capabilities will be more engaging than interventions with generic goals. Methods: The study was designed as a 2-arm randomized intervention trial. Participants were recruited among staff members of Noorderkempen governmental organization. They participated in an 8-week digital health promotion campaign that was especially designed to promote walks, bike rides, and sports sessions. Using an mHealth app, participants could track their performance on two social leaderboards: a leaderboard displaying the individual scores of participants and a leaderboard displaying the average scores per organizational department. The mHealth app also provided a news feed that showed when other participants had scored points. Points could be collected by performing any of the 6 assigned tasks (eg, walk for at least 2000 m). The level of complexity of 3 of these 6 tasks was updated every 2 weeks by changing either the suggested task intensity or the suggested frequency of the task. The 2 intervention arms-with participants randomly assigned-consisted of a personalized treatment that tailored the complexity parameters based on participants' self-reported capabilities and goals and a control treatment where the complexity parameters were set generically based on national guidelines. Measures were collected from the mHealth app as well as from intake and posttest surveys and analyzed using hierarchical linear models. Note: Eindhoven University of Technology is not an official GCP sponsor. Hence, this study is not a medical clinical trial."

            "Background: Acute pharyngitis (AP) is a common presentation to the Emergency Department (ED). Most AP patients' who present to the ED are interested in relief their sore throat (pain). There are different approaches available in the literature to control AP pain. Studies have shown that the use of systemic glucocorticoids significantly decreases patients' sore throat. Up to our knowledge, there are no available trials looking at the role of nebulized glucocorticoids in treating infective AP. Aim: Our aim is to investigate in pediatrics and adults population \u22655 years presenting to ED with AP if the use of a single dose of nebulized glucocorticoids as an adjunct to standard AP treatment, compared with placebo leads to complete resolution or improvement in symptoms. Method: The investigators are planning to conduct a multi-center, double-blind randomized control trial. There will be three arms; first arm: nebulized Budesonide, second arm: nebulized Dexamethasone and third arm: placebo nebulized Normal Saline (NS). The patients will be followed up for 7 days through phone calls to assess the primary and secondary outcomes. Our primary objective is to investigate whether the use of a single dose of nebulized glucocorticoids compared with placebo leads to significant improvement or complete resolution of the sore throat within 24hrs. Our secondary objectives are to assess if a single dose of glucocorticoids will: reduce sore throat at 48 hours, reduce absence from work or school, reduce the incidence of hospital admission, and reduce the rate of re-attendance to ED. Since there is no available data about the effect of nebulized glucocorticoids in AP, the appropriate sample size will be calculated after running a pilot study. The data will be recorded in the EpiData@ software. Then the data will be analyzed using the SPSS@ software. The ethical approval was sought from the ethical committee in each participating hospital and they approved it. Results: The result of this study will be presented in local conferences as well in international conferences. The investigators will aim to publish the study in a well-known international emergency medicine journal. Clinical application: up to our knowledge this study is the first study worldwide looking at the effect of nebulized glucocorticoids in patients with infective acute pharyngitis. As mentioned earlier that there are multiple approaches available in the literature to control sore throat pain and if our hypothesis turned to be correct then another alternative treatment can be added. The investigators believe that the use of topical route to administer glucocorticoids is more convenient for physicians and have less chance to develop adverse effect in comparison to systemic steroids."

The investigators aimed at evaluating whether robotic colectomy may offer some advantages over the laparoscopic approach for surgical treatment of diverticular disease by analyzing a one year multicenter prospective study. Primary objective is to evaluate if robotic approach reduce the rate of conversion to open approach compared to laparoscopic surgery. Secondary objective is to assess difference between the two approaches in terms of rate of intraoperative complication, postoperative morbidities (according with Clavien and Dindo Classification), hospital stay and at one year follow up. Inclusion criteria are: elective colectomy for complicated or non-complicated diverticular disease performed with laparoscopic or robotic approach and age between 18 and 90 years. Exclusion criteria are non-elective colectomy (emergency resection), open procedure, diverticular resection performed during other procedure (i.e. colectomy for cancer). Data will be collected in one year from the start of the study. Due to the lack of available evidence, it is impossible to draw definitive conclusions.

            "Vancomycin, a tricyclic glycopeptide antibiotic, was originally indicated for the treatment of penicillin-resistant S. Aureus. It has a bactericidal action, inhibiting the biosynthesis of the cell wall of Gram-positive bacteria. Various studies have reported the application of intraoperative vancomycin powder to the wound prior to wound closure as a method of antibiotic prophylaxis. Intrasite administration of the drug should theoretically minimize rapid absorption into the systemic circulation, thereby reducing drug-associated side effects. The precipitated concentration gradient between the local wound and the scaffold should also reduce the occurrence of drug resistance. In Haiti, monitoring patients post-operatively is often difficult. The Mortality, Morbidity and Use of Services Survey (EMMUS-VI 2016-2017) reports that the non-use of a health facility is motivated in 58% of cases by the excessively high economic cost of care. Also, SSIs represent a challenge for clinicians. The best solution to the consequences of SSI in this context is prevention. In the present study, the investigator tested the hypothesis that the use of vancomycin powder in the surgical wound would decrease the occurrence of SSI."

Sensitivity of this visual analysis, even when performed by experts in the field, is low, around 28% in one landmark publication. The impact of the display of Pmus together with the other ventilator waveforms on the ability of health-care professionals to identify asynchronies has not been tested so far. OBJECTIVES: To compare the sensitivity and specificity of the detection of patient-ventilator asynchrony by health professionals through visual inspection of the ventilator waveforms (conventional group) with the sensitivity and specificity of health professionals who have available, in addition to these ventilator waveforms, also the estimated inspiratory muscle pressure curve (Pmus group). METHODS: Participants will analyze 49 consecutive different scenarios of mechanical ventilation generated in a simulator. Intensive care unit physicians and respiratory therapist will be invited to participate and after the inclusion will be randomized to one of two groups: 1) the control group will inspect pressure and flow curves and 2) the Pmus group will inspect pressure, flow, and Pmus curves. Before the start of the study, all participants will have a 30-min training session to homogenize their concepts on the definitions of the different types of asynchrony. Subsequently, the participants will be randomized to the conventional group or Pmus group. Participants will be designated to watch different sessions, in groups of at most 20 individuals, according to their randomization. In these sessions, recorded ventilator waveforms will be projected to a large screen for 30 seconds. A still image containing a few ventilatory cycles will remain visible for another 30 seconds when participants will have to choose which asynchrony (if any) the participants can see on the screen. Sessions of the Pmus group will display, in addition to pressure and flow, the estimated muscle pressure curves. The main outcome is the asynchrony detection rate (sensitivity). It will be also compared specificity, positive and negative predictive values for asynchrony detection. Statistical significance will be set at an alpha level of 0.05. The sample size was estimated in 98 participants based on the expectation of a 10 percentage points difference in the sensitivity between groups."

In recent years, public and private initiatives have offered training in different formats, online courses, face to face courses, congresses, that have facilitated access to this knowledge for many professionals. However, this offer lacks a sufficiently deep approach, so that physiotherapists do not develop the necessary skills to put it into practice, in addition to being an area of knowledge in which the concepts need constant updating given the rapid scientific progress. As with any paradigm shift, there is resistance to change on the part of some professionals, but the extent to which this has a collective impact on the generalization of these interventions is unknown. From our point of view, lack of training is only one of the aspects that hinder the implementation of PNE. Working conditions (pressure of care, high physiotherapist/population ratios, limited time available) and organizational conditions (dependence on hospital services, lack of vision of this model by the PC team) could be among the main daily difficulties in implementing it.

In this sense, SAH is considered a major public health problem, given its high prevalence. However, despite the evidence of several effective treatments for SAH, in Brazil, it is estimated that 77% of hypertensive patients do not undergo any treatment. Among the possible reasons for this, the low adherence to the proposed treatment (pharmacological and non-pharmacological) and the deficiencies in health care systems in approaching the treatment of chronic diseases, such as SAH. In this context, in order to improve the control and treatment of patients with SAH, the development of innovative methodologies that provide strategies to increase adherence to drug treatment and facilitate changes in lifestyle are necessary. In this sense, the present proposal aims to develop an application for smartphones aimed at the treatment of SAH, with tools aimed at medication adherence, blood pressure monitoring, monitoring and promotion of physical activity and healthy lifestyle habits in hypertensive patients. Therefore, the study will be developed in three phases: Phase 1: application development; Phase 2: testing the effectiveness of the application in a controlled environment; and, Phase 3: usability testing of the application. In phase 2, a randomized controlled clinical trial will be conducted to test the effect of eight weeks of application use on laboratory blood pressure, physical activity level, adherence to medication treatment and general lifestyle. In Phase 3, the app will be available on Apple iTunes and Google Play. After the application is publicized in the media (advertisements on television, newspapers, radio) and in social groups, usability aspects will be evaluated, such as the number of downloads and the grade attributed to user evaluations, according to the sociodemographic characteristics of the user (sex, age, place of residence)."

            "A recent Diabetes UK Position Statement identified several key gaps in the evidence base that might improve mental wellbeing for people with diabetes; one of which was supporting people with diabetes and eating disorders. There is evidence indicating that disordered eating may be more prevalent in children and young people (CYP). Additionally, there is mounting supporting evidence for family-based treatments in both anorexia and bulimia. This study proposes to develop a psycho-education intervention for parents of CYP with Type 1 diabetes (T1D), which will include a one-day workshop with online, downloadable content, and to assess the feasibility of this intervention. Parents will be asked to complete questionnaires about eating habits, diabetes management (both behaviour and knowledge) and wellbeing at three time-points (baseline, one-month and three-months postintervention). Children will also be asked to complete measures on diabetes eating problems at the same time intervals. Parents randomised to the intervention arm will be invited to take part in a semi-structured interview and all parents will be invited to feedback on their participation. It is hypothesised that a psycho-education intervention aimed at parents will help prevent disordered eating in CYP with T1D and improve parental wellbeing."

Short skills-focused self-guided applications (SGA) on mobile phones are a cost-effective and scalable way to equip users with better stress-coping skills, but many SGA stress-coping programmes are not evidence-based, existing research is flawed with methodological problems and is also predominantly conducted in Western countries.

This study is a randomised-controlled trial (RCT) that evaluates the effectiveness of a recently developed mobile-phone SGA in improving stress coping in young adults. Hypothesis 1: The intervention group will report significantly lower stress symptoms at post-intervention and 1-month follow-up compared to the control group. Hypothesis 2: Coping self-efficacy will mediate the expected relationship between the use of the Stress-SGA and lower stress symptoms, i.e. people with higher coping self-efficacy will benefit more from the Stress-SGA than those with lower coping self-efficacy.

            "Digital Biotyping of FSHD Patients and Controls",
            "Facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (FSHD) is a devastating progressive muscle dystrophy. There is no treatment. FSHD is generally characterized by asymmetrical weakness and wasting of facial, shoulder girdle and upper arm muscles followed by weakness of muscles of the trunk and lower extremities, but disease severity varies widely between patients. Relatively long periods of stability are interspersed with short periods of potentially steep decline, leading overall to a slow but unpredictable rate of progression. Different genotypes underlying FSHD have been identified, but they result in highly similar phenotypes and at the molecular level converge on undue expression of the transcription factor, DUX4, in skeletal muscle, which is thought to (ultimately) lead to muscle wasting due to inflammation, apoptosis, and oxidative stress. There is no approved treatment, although various companies are engaged in FSHD drug discovery and development aimed in particular at reducing DUX4 expression. Multiple treatment options are currently under development in both preclinical and early clinical stages. However, these efforts face significant challenges in the path to regulatory approval. Because of the slow and variable rate of progression of FSHD, evidencing a significant treatment response will be cumbersome using only the existing measurements of muscle function. The successful development of these investigative treatments for FSHD is therefore highly dependent on the availability of validated disease and treatment biomarkers to monitor disease progression and response to treatment, respectively. To date, no such validated biomarkers exist. This study is important for four reasons: 1. Clinical testing of FSHD drug candidates requires the availability of clinical biomarkers that (a) change relatively rapidly over time; (b) allow for identification of fast progressors; and (c) correlate with \"gold standard\", but slowly changing, clinical severity and/or functional scores. This study is a first step in that direction as it seeks to explore if the investigational digital technologies described below are able to generate single or composite variables that (cross-sectionally) distinguish FSHD patients from controls. If identified, such variables will be tested as putative clinical FSHD biomarkers in a follow-up longitudinal study with FSHD patients. 2. Patient testimonies indicate that living with FSHD means living with pain, fatigue, social isolation, and anxiety about the future. This study provides the first-ever opportunity to gather objective, real-world data about the impact of FSHD on daily life. 3. Regulators have already indicated that Real-World Data (RWD) is a top strategic priority for their drug reviews. This study aims to fill this gap by gathering RWD about the physical and social activities of FSHD patients in comparison with controls. This way we aim to find (composite) scores that correlate with selected severity and functional scores and additionally distinguish FSHD patients from controls. 4. This study offers an opportunity to expand the spectrum of diseases in which RWD may be used as (a basis for) clinical outcome measures. A successful outcome of this study may support testing the MORE platform in other muscular dystrophies as well."

The current Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is caused by the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 experience unusually high rates of critical illness that needs advanced airway management and intensive care unit admission. Bag-valve-mask (BVM) ventilation, laryngeal mask airway insertion (LMA), and endotracheal Intubation (ETI) are common AGMP for critically ill COVID-19 patients, and may contribute to a high risk of infection amongst Health Care Workers (HCW). To lessen HCW risk during high-risk AGMPs, a device called an aerosol box has been developed to place over the head of the patient, shielding the provider's face from virus droplets suspended in the air. The purpose of this research study is to better understand how particles disperse during AGMPs. The project team hopes what is learned from the project can help inform infection control measures. This could help make changes to the clinical environment and make it safer for HCW's.

            "Despite increased visibility and acceptance of the LGBT community (Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender), in some parts of society, many LGBT people struggle with self-acceptance. Minority Stress Theory, described in the scientific literature, explains that health disparities among populations such as the LGBT population can be explained by stressors induced by a hostile, homophobic culture, which results in harm suffered, expectations of rejection, and internalized homophobia. The harm suffered may include acts of discrimination, harassment, violence (physical or linguistic). But more deeply, two important points of this theory: 1) the expectations of the LGBT person to experience rejection based on their identity and the anti-LGBT social stigma, 2) internalized homophobia, which is a social internalization from negativity against homosexuality and transgender to the initial stages of the identity development of an individual who can continue throughout his life. Perceived harm, stigma and lived rejection are associated with an increased propensity to experience significant psychological pain. LGBT people are more likely to develop self-identification based on sexual orientation or gender, making them more vulnerable to any rejection signal. There is a growing scientific interest around Cognitive and Behavioral Therapies (CBT) of 3rd wave, also called therapies derived from Buddhism, or therapies based on meditation. These programs aim to observe and test, through an experiential meta-cognitive practice, the dogmas or preconceptions (about ourselves, others, and the world) and mental attitudes that guide our choices without our knowledge and are at the origin of suffering, in order to gain inner freedom. These practices constitute an experiential scientific methodology of self-knowledge and reality. These secular programs have become a standard treatment in the management of stress, chronic pain, and the prevention of relapsing depression. In addition, the interest of these practices has been demonstrated in many areas of somatic and psychiatric medicine (including depression and suicidal behavior), but also for the promotion of mental health in the general population. This topic is the subject of more than 15,000 international scientific publications with reading committee (Medline indexed), and of strong interest and shared by both the scientific community and the general public. Scientists are currently deepening these therapies with a focus on wisdom-based self-identification. Beyond the name \"therapies\", this educational information is key to life for everyone. Who am I ? Am I defined by my social roles, my physical characteristics, my preferences? How to face external challenges? How to develop real self-confidence? Dr D\u00e9borah Ducasse offers a conference on the theme: \"Sexual orientation, gender: where is the problem?\" Nowhere. Self-identification. \". This conference will take place on 05/15/2020, on the occasion of World Day Against Homophobia. In line with the OECD press release in 2019 \"The LGBT challenge: how to improve the integration of sexual and gender minorities? \"(Panorama de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 2019: Social Indicators of the OECD), the investigators want to assess whether an intervention targeting valid self-identification can 1) have a positive impact on the acceptance and discrimination indicators of the OECD ; 2) have an impact on valid self-identification. Direct benefits are expected, psychologically and socially, in the fight against discrimination, inclusion and self-acceptance. In the medium and long term: major public health interest via the adaptation of psychoeducational interventions based on self-identification in order to prevent psychosocial risks and suicidal behavior in connection with an altered self-identification based on sexual orientation and gender."

Building on the existing evidence that increasing meaning and purpose in life is a strong predictor of decreased loneliness, interventions to reduce loneliness in this population may be strengthened by incorporating concepts from Meaning-Centered Psychotherapy (MCP). Thus, the overall goal of the proposed project is to reduce loneliness in care partners of patients with AD/ADRD through increasing their sense of meaning and purpose in life using concepts from MCP, delivered via a web-based platform, RELOAD-C (REducing LOneliness in Alzeheimer's Disease-Care Partners). This will be achieved through three Specific Aims. Aim 1 consists of three phases (preparatory work, stakeholder involvement with N=15 AD/ADRD care partners, and adaptation of the existing web-based platform) to produce RELOAD-C, which centralizes: 1) 6 brief videos portraying an MCP expert delivering MCP concepts; 2) links to 7 virtual group meetings (6 weekly + 1 booster) to discuss MCP concepts (of note, the support groups utilized in this study exist only as part of this research); and 3) written content expanding on the material from the MCP videos. Aim 2 evaluates usability/acceptability of RELOAD-C (defined as a task success rate \u2265 78%, and scores \u2265 68 on the System Usability Scale) with N=20 care partners of persons with AD/ADRD. Aim 3 proposes a pilot RCT to evaluate the preliminary efficacy of the RELOAD-C components (MCP videos vs. MCP-focused group discussions) in reducing loneliness and feasibility of conducting a future, large-scale RCT. N=96 AD/ADRD care partners will be randomized to: usual care, n=32; MCP videos alone via RELOAD-C, n=32; or MCP videos + weekly groups via RELOAD-C, n=32. Care partners' outcomes will be assessed at baseline, and 6-weeks and 3-months post-baseline. The investigators expect the effect sizes will be in the moderate range (.3). Feasibility is defined as: \u2265 75% consented, \u2264 30% drop-out, and 80% engagement with intervention. Reducing loneliness among care partners is of high public health significance and incorporating MCP in loneliness interventions is highly innovative. In sum, the investigators will enroll 15 care partners during Aim 1, 20 care partners during Aim 2, and 96 care partners during Aim 3."

Methods: The research has been carried out in a real trial model with adult patients receiving chemotherapy. The sample of the study is consisted of 92 patients (45 in the experimental group and 47 for the control group). The data have been collected by the researcher with Google Forms (using State and Transient Anxiety Inventory and Visual Analog Skala) between March 2020 and July 2020, through the links sent to the phones of participants on the day they received chemotherapy. Results: The mean scores obtained from the post-test STAI (53.11\u00b14.77) and VAS (3.44\u00b12.53) scales in the experimental group have been determined to statistically significantly decrease when compared to the pre-test measurement data (STAI:54.26\u00b14.26; VAS:4.22\u00b12.41) (p<0.05). No statistically significant difference has been determined between pre-test and post-test mean scores of the patients in the control group. Conclusion: It has been observed that music applications reduce the pain and anxiety levels of patients receiving chemotherapy during the COVID-19 process. It can be recommended to use music applications in the management of pain and anxiety symptoms."

            "Cognitive decline and sleep complaints are prevalent in older adults and severely affect older adults' physical health and quality of life. Sedentary lifestyle, which is reported by 90% of older Americans, is an important risk factor for both cognitive decline and sleep disturbances. Although promoting physical activity has benefits to older adults' health, including sleep and cognition, traditional interventions to increase activity are challenging due to extensive staffing requirements and low adherence. Electronic activity monitors, such as wrist-worn accelerometers, can track heart rate, activity, and sleep to allow individuals to work towards personal activity and sleep goals. These appealing features make these devices ideal for interventions that aim to change behaviors and improve health outcomes. However, the efficacy of using electronic activity monitors to promote physical activity and health in older adults has not been examined. The investigators will conduct a randomized controlled trial in a cohort of older adults (without dementia) with both sedentary lifestyle and nocturnal sleep complaints to examine the effectiveness of a personalized behavioral intervention (compared to a control group) embedded within a smart watch application in older adults. 94 cognitively intact elders and 21 older adults with mild cognitive impairment will be enrolled and randomly allocated to the intervention or control group. Participants in the intervention arm will receive in person exercise training sessions, and personalized, self-monitor physical activity, receive interactive prompts, biweekly phone consultation with the research team, and financial incentives for achieving weekly physical activity goals. The control group will receive general education on physical activity in older adults and continue the routine daily activity during the intervention period. The intervention for older adults without cognitive impairment is 24 weeks and for older adults with mild cognitive impairment is 16 weeks."

The 2020 global coronavirus pandemic has created a situation characterized by increased anxiety. The present international survey was designed to examine associations between exposure to quarantine/isolation measures, anxiety levels and changes in dietary patterns. Methods: The present study utilizes a Google Survey platform to conduct an international survey querrying dietary patterns before vs. after the coronavirus pandemic; anxiety during the pandemic; and demographic characteristics. The nutrition portion of the survey is based on the Mediterranean Diet Score while the anxiety estimate is based on the GAD-7. The survey is available in English, Hebrew, Spanish, Italian, French, Arabic and Russian. It has been distributed via social media. Anticipated Results: We believe that changes in dietary habits will be identified and that these will be associated with anxiety levels. Additionally, we believe that by-country differences will be identified. Discussion: The Google Survey format distributed by social media provides an almost immediate means of distributing the survey globally. The survey can only be completed if the respondent first indicates his/her informed consent. The convenience sample limits generalizability to individuals who volunteer to complete online surveys; however, we anticipate a large response which may mitigate this limitation."

            "Skin cancer is the most common cancer and can be deadly, debilitating, damaging, and disfiguring, yet is highly preventable. In 2014, the US Surgeon General made a call to action about the \"major public health problem\" of skin cancer, noting potential contributions of behavioral science and education, and a need for investments in such efforts. Almost five million Americans are treated for skin cancer annually, and incidence is rising. Risk factors for melanoma and non-melanoma skin cancers include personal or family history of skin cancer, certain physical characteristics (e.g., fair skin, numerous moles), as well as excessive ultraviolet (UV) radiation exposure. Our work shows that skin cancer risk behaviors, including sunburns, indoor tanning, and lack of protection peak at age 25. Thus, young adulthood is an important window for skin cancer risk reduction interventions. However, young adults tend to be resistant to public health recommendations because, as a group, they perceive themselves as having more immediate priorities than disease prevention, that the consequences of their current health behaviors are in the distant future, and they also tend to be experimenters and risk-takers highly influenced by peers. The principal investigator developed a web-based intervention (UV4.me) that was found to significantly decrease UV exposure and increase skin protection behaviors among young adults in a randomized controlled trial of nearly 1000 participants. The objective of this project is to investigate the reach, effectiveness, implementation, maintenance, and cost of an enhanced version of that web intervention (UV4.me2) in a large national randomized controlled trial. The ultimate goal is to improve the skin cancer protection behaviors (and potentially decrease skin cancer incidence) among a national sample of young adults at moderate to high risk of developing skin cancer. Primary Aim 1. To enhance and determine intervention reach (i.e., enrollment, representativeness). Primary Aim 2. To determine the effectiveness of the enhanced intervention. Secondary Aim 1. To determine maintenance of the UV4.m4 and UV4.me2 interventions through evaluation at 6 and 12-month follow-up. Secondary Aim 2. To determine intervention implementation by young adults. Secondary Aim 3. To determine the costs of the UV4.me and UV4.me2 interventions."

The Second Mental Health Study found a significant increase in the lifetime prevalence for GAD, from 0.9% to 1.6%. In addition, the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development found that among Singaporean students, 86% experienced anxiety levels that were significantly higher than the OECD average. Past research revealed that individuals who worried more experienced decreases in life satisfaction. It was also found that worry and anxiety are significant predictors of one's psychological wellbeing . In line with this trend, the market for wellbeing apps have been one of the fastest growing categories of apps ever since; with more than 10,000 on the market. Studies have shown that the use of wellbeing apps has been correlated with an improvement in mental wellbeing. However, due to the lack of research that focuses on disorder-specific evidence, there still exists debates around the effectiveness of wellbeing apps on anxiety and worry. In addition, the lack of research on the mediating factor of psychological mindedness in the relationship between the use of wellbeing apps and mental well-being, could be pivotal to the effectiveness of wellbeing apps. To show the effectiveness of evidence-based wellbeing apps in targeting anxiety and worry, this study will employ the engagement of participants with a wellbeing app for a controlled period of 2 weeks before recording their mental wellbeing outcomes.This paradigm has been replicated extensively through multiple studies. This study will use a between-groups experimental study design whereby participants will be block randomised into 2 conditions: Active control condition, and Anxiety condition. Each condition will be given a restricted version of the wellbeing app according to their treatment groups. Follow-up data will be collected at 2-weeks post intervention to establish efficacy of the intervention. Objective 1: To evaluate the effectiveness of a wellbeing app self-help programme for reducing anxiety and worry. Objective 2: To examine if psychological mindedness moderates hypothesised effects of wellbeing app usage and anxiety and worry. Hypothesis 1: Participants in the intervention group will report significantly lower anxiety and worry than participants in the control group. Hypothesis 2: Psychological mindedness will moderate the effect of the wellbeing app's self-help programme on anxiety and worry: Participants high in psychological mindedness will benefit more from the wellbeing apps than those with lower scores on psychological mindedness."

It is a heterogeneous disease, which is associated with long-term disability, leading to reduced quality of life (QoL). Disease-modifying pharmacological therapies (DMT) decrease activity and progression of the disease, and symptomatic pharmacological treatments reduce complaints to a certain extent, however MS patients often still suffer from various neurological deficits during the course of their disease (Kamm et al. 2014). Consequently, specific non-pharmacological therapies are needed in order to further reduce disability, eventually resulting in better QoL (Lamers et al. 2016; Vanbellingen & Kamm, 2016). Impaired dexterity is a frequently observed impairment, affecting up to 76% of patients with MS (Johannson et al. 2007). The different neurological deficits caused by MS, such as ataxia, spasticity, sensory-motor deficits, and apraxia may be alone or in combination, impair manual dexterity (Kamm et al. 2012; Heldner, Vanbellingen et al. 2014). MS patients experience impairments in the performance of several activities of daily living (ADL), such as grooming, cooking, etc. Sometimes these problems are even associated with loss of work, and lack of social integration (Chruzander et al. 2013). The effectiveness of the app based exercises still needs to be proven. With respect to dexterity, a first new app has been developed called \"Finger Zirkus\", by a team of experts including an occupational therapist, graphic designer, and IT expert. The app is already available to be downloaded from google play store or apple store (see for more details: www.fingers-in-motion.de)."

            "Introduction and Purpose: Compression is a tactile stimulus that can reduce the perception of pain by stimulating tactile skin receptors and the speed of nerve conduction. It is highly associated with cryotherapy and other non-pharmacological physical agents without musculoskeletal pain control. However, there is still a lack of evidence on its possible effects on the modulation of this type of pain. This study will evaluate the effect of compression by elastic bandages, on pain and on the function of belonging with knee osteoarthritis (KO). Methodology: A randomized, blinded controlled clinical trial will be conducted. Individuals with KO (n = 90; both sexes; between 40 and 75 years old), will be allocated into three groups (n = 30 / group): Compression (submitted to compression by elastic bandage on the affected knee, 20 min, in 4 days consecutive); Sham (submitted to the same protocol with elastic bandage, but without compression); and Control (waiting list, without intervention). All will be taken one day before the start and one day after the last intervention. They will also be adopted in the 12th and 24th weeks after the intervention. The main outcome will be the pain intensity (Visual Analogue Scale). The Western Ontario & McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis (WOMAC) physical function questionnaire, physical function tests (step test, sit and stand test in 30s, 40m accelerated walk test), and the perception scale global change (GRC). Data analysis: SPSS 24.0 software will be used for descriptive analysis and performance of Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests, two-way ANOVA and multiple comparison tests. A 95% confidence level and a 5% significance level will be adopted."

This study was designed experimentally with a randomized control group. Methods: A total of 76 COPD patients were included in the study. Individuals aged 40 and over with COPD were included in the study, while individuals with communication, mental, neurological and cognitive problems and unable to exercise were excluded from the study. Among those who met the inclusion criteria, those who had a smart-phone were assigned to the experimental group, while those who did not have a smart-phone were assigned to the control group. Self-management training was given to all individuals in both the control and experimental groups. After the training, the Saint George Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) and dyspnea tests were administered to both groups. After the rehabilitation exercise program developed for the patients in the experimental group was applied, the tests were repeated for all groups. Results: The mean age of the patients in the study was 65.5708\u00b1 9 in the control group, while the mean age of the experimental group was 67.61\u00b1 9.93. While the Borg dyspnea scale results of the experimental group were 6.45\u00b1 1.90 in the first test, the post-test measurements were 5.16\u00b1 1.65 (t = 7.66, p = 0.00).

They include micturition problems, defecation problems, pelvic organ prolapse, sexual problems and genito-pelvic pain. The pelvic floor is an anatomical and functional unit, and therefore different PFS may co-occur. However, literature on prevalence of clusters of PFS is scarce. Furthermore, PFS is understudied in the male population and when studies are performed in male subjects, studies do not assess the complete scope of possible PFS. Objective: To generate a cohort, which provides information on sex- and gender differences in: prevalence and incidence of (clinically relevant clusters of) PFS, risk factors and prognostic factors for PFS, factors that reveal the impact of PFS on daily life, help seeking behavior and use of health care. Study design: Prospective observational population-based cohort study with follow-up moments after 1 year and 2 years. Data of the questionnaire will be connected to medical record data from the participating general practitioners (GPs). A representative sample of female and male subjects with and without PFS will be invited for a physical examination to assess pelvic floor disorders and muscle function. Furthermore, a subsample of patients will be invited for a qualitative study consisting of semi-structured interviews on healthcare seeking behavior, including barriers and facilitators, preferences and satisfaction.

Main study parameters: To evaluate the sex- and gender difference in prevalence and incidence of (clinically relevant clusters of) PFS, the following primary parameters are assessed: lower urinary tract symptoms, bowel symptoms, urogenital prolapse (females only), sexual functioning, and pain. Secondary study parameters are factors associated with the development of PFS ('risk factors'), factors that predict the course of PFS ('prognostic factors'), factors that reveal the impact of PFS on daily life, help seeking behavior, and health care use (consultations for PFS and consultation frequency, diagnostic tests, diagnoses, treatment, and referrals)."

            "Foods in the human diet can affect the development of diseases over time, such as diabetes or heart disease. This is because the amount and types of foods in the diet eat can affect a person's weight, and because different foods are metabolised (processed) by the body in different ways. Scientists have also found that the bacteria in the human gut (the gut microbiome) affect their metabolism, weight and health and that, together with a person's diet and metabolism, could be used to predict appetite and how meals affect the levels of sugar (glucose) and fats (lipids) found in blood after eating. If blood sugar and fat are too high too often for too long, there is a greater chance of developing diseases such as diabetes and cardiovascular disease. The gut microbiome is different in different people. Only 10-20% of the types of bacteria found in the human gut are found in everyone. This might mean that the best diet to prevent disease needs matching to a person's gut microbiome and it might be possible to find personalised foods or diets that will help reduce the chance of developing chronic disease as well as metabolic syndrome. The study investigators are recruiting volunteers aged 18-70 years to take part in a study that aims to answer the questions above. Participants will be asked to consume standardised meals on up to 8 days while wearing glucose monitors (Abbott Freestyle Libre) to measure their blood sugar levels. Participants will also be required to prick their fingers at regular intervals to collect small amounts of blood, and to record their appetite, food, physical activity and sleep using apps and wearable devices. They will be asked to collect a fecal and saliva sample before consuming the standardised meals, and to provide a fasted blood sample at the end of the study period."

            "Obesity disproportionately impacts sexual minority women. Behavioral weight loss programs are the gold standard treatment for mild to moderate obesity. The investigators have developed an online behavioral weight loss program that is effective, low-cost, and highly scalable. However, existing research suggests that tailoring treatment to address 3 well-established weight loss barriers in sexual minority women will be critical for maximizing the relevance and efficacy of behavioral weight loss for this group. In the Preparation Phase of this K23, the investigators developed 3 novel treatment components targeting sexual minority women's weight loss barriers (i.e., minority stress, low social support, and negative body image), the investigators piloted the program among sexual minority women of higher weight, and the investigators conducted individual qualitative interviews to elicit feedback on the intervention's acceptability, cultural relevance, usability, and feasibility, and this feedback was used to refine the program. In the Optimization Phase of this K23 (the current phase), 88 women will receive 12 weeks of Rx Weight Loss and will be randomized to receive 0-3 tailored components in a full factorial design with 23 (8) distinct combinations of components. Novel components that increase mean weight loss (by \u22652%) or the proportion of women achieving clinically meaningful weight loss (by \u226510%) at 6 months will be retained in a finalized obesity treatment package that the investigators will evaluate in a future randomized controlled trial (RCT) (Evaluation Phase). The aims of this study are to: Aim 2A (Optimization): Use a factorial experiment to determine how 3 novel components impact mean weight loss and the proportion of women achieving a 5+% weight loss at 6 months. Aim 2B (Mediation): Clarify how tailored components impact weight loss by testing hypothesized mechanisms of action (i.e., coping with stress, perceived social support, weight and shape concerns). This project will tailor and optimize an evidence-based online behavioral obesity treatment to enhance weight loss outcomes in sexual minority women."

            "Pregnancy and delivery are major stressors on the female body and contribute significantly to permanent weight gain and associated morbidity in women. This can profoundly affect the ability of active duty (AD) women to advance in their career. The first 12 weeks postpartum are the time period during which the most significant weight loss occurs and is critical in achieving a healthy weight in the first year postpartum. Many factors contribute to effective weight loss in this period among which the most critical are diet, exercise, and sleep. Breast feeding and depression may also affect weight changes postpartum. Research has shown diet to likely be the most crucial of these factors. The PADaWL study is designed as a randomized controlled trial to assess the effects of dietary intervention on weight and physical fitness versus routine postpartum care in the first year postpartum. Subjects will be primiparous AD women from any military service recruited in the obstetric clinic in the third trimester of pregnancy at Tripler Army Medical Center. Data will collected in an ambi-directional fashion with pre-pregnancy physical fitness data, demographic and pregnancy data collected at time of enrollment. Subjects will be randomized to receive intensive virtual sessions with a dietician vs routine postpartum care for the first 12 months postpartum. We will utilize a biometric device to monitor activity levels and sleep, web-based diaries to monitor breast feeding and diet, and validated questionnaires to evaluate depression as well as diet and sleep. Subjects will be monitored weekly for the first 12 weeks postpartum and will then be further evaluated at 6, 9 and 12 months postpartum. Primary outcome is weight at 12weeks postpartum and whether subjects have achieved military standards. Secondary outcome will be weight at 12 months postpartum and whether subject has achieved weight and fitness standards. The study intends to collect large amounts of data, and we intend to analyze which factors may be contributing to weight retention postpartum. This study should provide an accurate assessment of the effects of pregnancy on AD women. It should generate a clean and accurate dataset on which multiple follow-on studies can be performed and provide data for designing further intervention studies in postpartum women. The results of this study should also be able to assist in developing policy and guidance concerning AD women and pregnancy."

Deterioration of erectile function could be attributed to persistence of storage symptoms specially nocturia. Several pathophysiologic mechanisms, described before, are involved in pathogenesis of LUTS and ED and one can imagine that after relief of obstruction, the erectile function should improve, however lack of improvement or even deterioration suggests that damage associated with these mechanisms is irreversible and patients may require some sort of penile rehabilitation after surgery. The investigators hypothesized that Tadalafil may enhance relief of storage symptoms and enhance recovery of erectile function after surgery for BPH. With this assumption, a RCT was designed to examine the utility and efficacy of Tadalafil, once daily dose, to relieve persistent/ de novo storage symptoms and early erectile function deterioration after endoscopic prostate surgery."

            "Diastolic function is a combination of ventricular chamber compliance, active myofilament relaxation, and elastic recoil of systolic potential energy. Diastole is classically divided into four stages-isovolumetric relaxation, early rapid filling, late slow filling, and atrial contraction. Isovolumetric relaxation refers to the rapid decrease in LV pressure with little or no change in volume and ends with the opening of the mitral valve and early LV filling. These early phases, sometimes referred to as LV suction, are characterized by a rapid decline in LV intracavity pressure and require energy in the form of ATP to pump cytosolic calcium back into the sarcoplasmic reticulum and enable uncoupling of actin and myosin. Filling later in diastole is more dependent on ventricular compliance. Up to investigator knowledge, the effect of mechanical ventilation on patient hemodynamics is still unclear especially in patients with diastolic dysfunction. The optimal ventilation mode for anesthesia of patient with diastolic dysfunction remains a subject of debate. The primary outcome of this study is to investigate whether the pressure regulated volume-controlled mode (PRVC) in comparison with the volume-controlled mode in patients with diastolic dysfunction is associated with better hemodynamic alterations and different vasopressors support during anesthesia for radical cystectomy."

            "Cervical radiculopathy is a pain and/or sensorimotor deficit syndrome that is defined as being caused by compression of a cervical nerve root .The compression can occur as a result of disc herniation, spondylosis, instability, trauma, or rarely, tumors. Patient presentations can range from complaints of pain, numbness, and/or tingling in the upper extremity to electrical type pains or even weakness. The clinical overlap between cervical radiculopathy and peripheral nerve entrapment syndromes and their nearly ubiquitous nature makes understanding of and identification of these entities mandatory for all practitioners The cervical spinal nerves exit the spinal cord and are oriented obliquely toward their respective neural foramen .The neural foramen is made up of the facet joint posteriorly and the intervertebral disc anteriorly. The superior and inferior borders are comprised of the pedicles of the vertebral bodies above and below, respectively. The foramina are largest in the upper cervical spine and gradually narrow distally, with the C7/T1 foramina being the narrowest. The most common causes of nerve root compression are spondylosis of the facet joint and herniation of the intervertebral disc.Hypermobility of the facet joint leads to ligamentous hypertrophy as well as bony hypertrophy. An increase in the size of the superior articulating process from the distal vertebra causes compression of the nerve. Intervertebral disc herniations can also cause nerve root compression from the anterior aspect of the foramen. Disc herniations can either be acute or chronic. Imaging modalities and electrophysiologic testing (EMG & NCV) play an important role in the diagnosis and localization of cervical radiculopathy. The first test that is typically done is plain x-ray. Computed tomography is the most sensitive test for examination of the bony structures of the spine. Initial strategies in the treatment of cervical radiculopathy are typically Conservative therapies including multiple pharmacologic agents, immobilization, physical therapy, manipulation, traction, and TENS . Traditionally, cervical spine injection performed under fluoroscopy or computed tomography guidance. However, these imaging tools are not able to visualize small vessels, and incidences such as brainstem or spinal cord infarction may occur. These complications are believed to be caused by inadvertent injection of therapeutic agents into the vertebral or radicular arteries. Therefore, accidental puncture of vessels must be prevented when performing neck injection procedures. Recently, high-resolution musculoskeletal ultrasound (US) can be used to identify the target root and the nearby vessels. The advantage of using US as a guidance tool is that it does not expose patients or medical personnel to radiation such as fluoroscopy or computed tomography guidance. Ultrasound allows good visualization of the soft tissue such as abnormal blood vessels in the foramen and around the nerve root, which further enables accurate needle placement and avoids the risk of intravascular injections. In addition, US-guided procedures have a shorter duration compared to those guided by fluoroscopy and do not result in contrast medium-related allergic reactions . As a result, US-guided cervical nerve root block (US-CRB) is a safe alternative treatment technique that can be used in the treatment of upper extremity radicular pain."

            "Hysteroscopy is a common procedure where a camera attached to a thin scope is passed into the uterus via the vagina and cervix in order to obtain views of the inside of the uterus. Hysteroscopy is used for the diagnosis and management of a variety of benign and conditions as well as the diagnosis of uterine cancer. It can be performed under general anaesthetic or in an outpatient setting without formal anaesthetic. The latter has several advantages when compared to hysteroscopy with general anaesthesia as it avoids the additional risk of general anaesthesia, has a quicker recovery time, shorter hospital stay and reduced cost. However, women may experience discomfort or pain during an outpatient procedure and pain is one of the most common reasons for failure to complete the procedure. The most appropriate way to manage pain and anxiety during outpatient hysteroscopy is not yet fully understood and conventional therapy, as recommended by the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, involves the use of simple pain killers taken prior to the procedure and sometimes local anaesthetic during the procedure. In recent years virtual reality software has been developed and used in a variety of different settings to alleviate pain and anxiety during medical procedures. This study aims to investigate whether the use of virtual reality as an adjunct to conventional pain management can reduce anxiety and pain during outpatient hysteroscopy. The study will take the form of a randomised controlled trial at St Mary's hospital London. A randomly selected group of patients undergoing outpatient hysteroscopy with conventional management plus the addition of virtual reality software will be compared to a control group of patients undergoing the procedure with conventional management only."

Post-mastectomy pain control is crucial as acute postoperative pain is a significant factor in the development of persistent chronic pain in the form of post-mastectomy pain syndrome. Post-mastectomy pain syndrome (PMPS) is a common complication after breast cancer surgery and is often challenging to manage. It is estimated that PMPS occurs in 20%-44% of patients after breast surgery. Adequate pain control for PMPS has become one of the most important goals and recently can achieve by multiple tools including multimodal analgesia and regional techniques. Erector spinae block (ESB) is one of the new described regional techniques. Although its mechanism is not clear, the published data agree that it is promising block for chronic and acute pain and its simplicity and safety compared with thoracic epidural or bilateral paravertebral blocks. ESB can be performed using a superficial approach between the large rhomboid muscle and the erector spinae muscle or the deep method beneath the erector spinae. The use of the ESPB for chronic pain has recently expanded for various neuropathic pain conditions. Also, it reported with several volumes range from 10 to 30 ml of total volume."

            "Acute pancreatitis (AP) represents a critical health concern nationwide, with estimated 274,000 admissions annually and at a cost of 2.6 billion dollars. Current treatment strategies for AP are limited to supportive care with fluid resuscitation, analgesia, nutrition and prevention of end organ damage. Abdominal pain is often the predominant symptom in patients with AP and is treated with analgesics. As there is currently no disease-specific medical treatment to change the natural history of pancreatitis, pain control remains central to the treatment of AP. Among the analgesics, opioids have been shown to be provide safe and effective pain control in patients with AP. Current literature shows that there is no difference in the risk of pancreatitis complications or clinically serious adverse events between opioids and other analgesia options. Among hospitalized AP patients, adequate pain control often requires the use of intravenous (IV) opiates in the first 24-48 hours, which can later be transitioned to oral (PO) opioids. While there are various methods of delivering opioid medications such as IV, PO, and transdermal to name a few, IV opioids are commonly administered, either on a scheduled and/or on an as needed (PRN) basis as directed by the attending physician. In contrast to the conventional, method of physician directed IV opioid delivery, patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) is a form of IV opioid medication delivery in which the patient can rapidly titrate the opioid dose to manage variable levels of pain. This modality of opioid administration is often preferred by patients and has been widely used in postsurgical and obstetric patients to effectively treat their pain. PCA allows for faster intervention on pain limiting time to treatment and peak pain levels and has also been shown to decrease total opioid dose. However, there is limited evidence in published literature assessing the feasibility of using PCA to treat the pain of AP or comparing its efficacy and safety profile compared to the more traditional physician directed analgesia. One retrospective study has shown that use of PCA was surprisingly associated with longer hospital stays and higher rates of outpatient opioid use when compared to routine physician-directed analgesia (PDA), however there are no prospective trials to study this comparison. Hence, in this study, the investigators will compare the effects of using PCA among patients with AP to that of conventional PDA."

Medial branch nerve blocks show moderate evidence of long-term benefit with evidence of side effects.3 Paraneuraxial nerve blocks have become very popular clinically, due to their clinical and anatomical characteristics. These techniques are comparable to neuraxial nerve blocks in terms of success rate and analgesic efficacy and may confer many of advantages over neuraxial nerve blocks.4 Retrolaminar blocks are among this family that are near but not within the neuraxis like spinals or epidurals.5 Most reports and studies of retrolaminar blocks have been in the context of anesthesia for truncal surgery and truncal pain syndromes (thoracic and abdominal).6 Postoperative and pain treatment cervical retrolaminar blocks studies are currently sparse.7 The major advantage of this technique is minimizing or even eliminating the risk of pneumothorax. Additionally, the risks of nerve root damage and inadvertent injection into a dural sleeve, an intervertebral foramen, or the epidural or intrathecal spaces should also be decreased.8"

            "Neonatal sepsis still considered as one of the major causes of mortality and morbidity during the neonatal period due to high vulnerability of that age group. The blood culture is considered as the gold standard for diagnosis of bacterial sepsis, however in early onset neonatal sepsis (EONS) the inability to isolate a microbial pathogen does not exclude sepsis. The reason behind the high number of culture-negative cases is not clear and might be attributed to low levels of bacteremia or small volumes of blood obtained from sick infants. Also maternal antibiotic treatment before or during delivery may theoretically mask detection of bacteremia in the newborn. In addition these cultures have a 48-72 hours delay to obtain results. Therefore, the combination of clinical assessment and laboratory biomarkers currently are the bases for diagnosis of neonatal sepsis. Recently interleukin-27 (IL-27) has been looked at as another candidate biomarker in the serum for diagnosis of sepsis in both adult and children. Interleukin-27 (IL-27), a novel member of the IL-12 family, was first discovered in 2002. IL- 27 is primarily synthesized by antigen-presenting cells, and it is widely expressed in a myriad of cells, including placental trophoblast cells. Although multiple studies have reported IL-27 as an essential regulator of immune response and inflammation, its precise role in the immune response is still disputable. Conventionally, IL-27 has been envisaged as a potent promoter of inflammation. When first discovered, it was characterized as a promoting factor in the rapid initiation of inflammatory responses, processing the ability to stimulate the rapid expansion of na\u00efve CD4+T and then the production of IFN-?, which has been demonstrated by various subsequent studies. The aim of this study was to evaluate the usage of elevated IL-27 in cord blood as an early predictor biomarker for EONS."

Muscle wasting is a strong predictor of frailty and reduced survival in HF patients. Currently, standard treatments for slowing muscle loss in patients with HF are not available. The main intervention remains various types of physical activity programs. Telemonitoring is a promising strategy for improving heart failure outcomes by making it possible to monitor patients remotely. There are numerous examples of home-based exercise programs administered through telehealth services that have been beneficial for maintaining physical activity levels. These results highlight the potential utility of telehealth services for combatting sedentarism and muscle wasting among epidemic and post-epidemic phases. Objective\uff1a The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of a multi-component physical activity program based on home telemonitoring on patients with heart failure and muscle wasting. Methods\uff1a This study used an quasi-experimental study, two-group repeated measurement design. The experimental group received the Home-based exercise with telemonitoring and control group according to regular nursing care. Data were collected at baseline (T0), and post-tests will be conducted right after the intervention period (T1). Additionally, detraining effects will be measured 12 weeks after program cessation (T2) . Data were collected including demographic questionnaire, sarcopenia, cachexia assessment, clinical blood parameters from patient record, physical activity, loneliness, and quality of life. Scientific or Clinical Implication of the Expected Results\uff1a The study results can be used to design designated interventions and provide information for policymaking."

            "Oral care is a fundamental aspect of nursing that impact the health and comfort of patients over both the short and long term. Caring for very sick patients in a busy stressful environment may result in oral care having a lower priority for nurses than other aspects of care (Sarangi, Simon, & Sarangi, 2021). Negligence of these interventions can cause long-term oral problems and nosocomial diseases most notably VAP (Abd Alraheem, 2020). A study conducted by Ay\u015fe et al. (2019) reported that the application of regular oral care for the MV patients as a part of care protocols decreased bacterial colonization and had a protective and improving effect on oral health. A recent study conducted by Rizk, Saad-eldeen and Helmy (2020) concluded that VAP is a serious ICU acquired infection with significant impact and required effective preventive action. A systematic review conducted by Kharel, Bist and Mishra (2021) concluded that VAP is a critical issue in ICU with a high-cost burden and various interventional educational programs like staff training and hygiene awareness can reduce the future risk of VAP. A recent study conducted by Abd Alraheem (2020) illustrated that 53.3% of the MV patients had average oral alteration. Asystematic review conducted by Kharel et al. (2021) to assess VAP among ICU patients in WHO South east Asian region illustrated that the VAP incidence rate ranged from 0.2% to 11.6% differing greatly between countries. The highest VAP prevalence rate was reported from the medical ICU, India, where as the lowest was from the palliative care ICU, South Korea. In Egypt, analysis of VAP was done in some Egyptian University Hospitals by Fathy, Abdelhafeez, EL-Gilany and Abd Elhafez, (2013) who reported that the incidence of VAP ranged from 16% to 75%, the lowest ratio was in Alexandria University 16% and the highest one in Ain Shams University 75%. The incidence in Mansoura University Hospitals (MUH) was 22.6%. Another recent study conducted by Elkolaly, Bahr, El-Shafey, Basuoni, and Elber (2019) reported that the incidence of VAP in Tanta University Hospitals is still high (38.4%). Many studies investigated the effect of oral care with chlorhexidine on the incidence of VAP and oral health in MV patients (Abd Alraheem, 2020; Collins et al., 2020; Heck, 2012; Moustafa, Tantawey, El-Soussi and Ramadan, 2016; Plantinga et al., 2016). However, the recent reappraisal of the evidence suggests that chlorhexidine does not reduce VAP, causes excess mortality in non-cardiac surgery patients (Dale et al., 2019) and unexpected high incidence of oral mucosal lesions (Plantinga et al., 2016). Moreover, from my empirical experience, chlorhexidine is not available in all Egyptian hospitals because of its economic burden. A study conducted by Moustafa et al. (2016) recommended regular updates about evidence-based guidelines for oral care and its effect on VAP prevention and oral health. The debate of the literature about oral care inspired us to investigate this area."

Mechanical ventilation is frequently applied to protect the airway from the risk of aspiration and to prevent both hypoxemia and hypercapnia, which are two major systemic factors of secondary brain insult. Mechanical ventilation after endotracheal intubation predisposes these patients to an increased incidence of pulmonary complications such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), increased risk of deep vein thrombosis, bedsores, increased hospital stay, and poor clinical outcome. The weaning process from MV involves the reduction of ventilator parameters and Extubation. Daily, careful evaluation of clinical and neurological conditions and completion of spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) should be considered in order to recognize and facilitate the process of withdrawal of the MV. The diaphragm which is the principal respiratory muscle provides nearly 75% of the resting pulmonary ventilation. However, In ICU patients, the diaphragm is vulnerable to damage from hypotension, hypoxia, and sepsis.

            "Mental health disorders are one of the most challenging chronic conditions to identify, treat and manage. This is largely due to the fact that diagnoses are almost entirely based on the patient's recall of current and past subjective experiences of symptoms; and then further interpreted by a healthcare professional introducing multiple layers of information biases in the formulation of a diagnosis. Accordingly, mental health conditions remain prevalent with high rates of misdiagnosis, inappropriate treatment and delayed intervention. In light of the heterogeneity across and within mental health conditions, a personalized interventional approach holds merit, yet the tools to effectively track an individual's day to day objective and subjective experience needed to achieve an individualized care approach have not until recently existed. Digital technologies such as passive and active sensing from smartphones and from wearable devices are shedding light on the capabilities of tracking new objective measures of health that could translate to key symptoms of mental health conditions. 'Multimodal data' approaches are those that attempt to translate a variety of electrical signals from digital devices to relevant health outcomes. The combination of digital devices to detect multimodal measures of mental health symptoms offers a unique opportunity to take a ground up approach in understanding the fluidity of mental health symptoms occurring at the individual level that might lend insight into new phenotypes of mental health illnesses that could have a physiological underpinning. The Study Investigators aim to characterize the multiplexing and fluid nature of mental health symptoms across individuals experiencing mental health symptoms and conditions using digital tools (i.e., wearables and mobile apps) and additional context information collected from virtual study support calls. The Investigators hope to know how objective measures from sensor data translate to core symptoms, episodes and flares across mental health disorders, and develop new (or new applications of) machine learning anomaly detection approaches and determine whether anomalies in expected symptom portraits can be reliably detected and enhanced by the addition of objectively measured data."

In the closed reduction (non-surgical), the bone fragments are realigned manually or by using traction devices. The open reduction surgery of mandibular fractures should first ensure the restoration of the occlusion of the mandible to prevent postoperative malocclusion, followed by stabilization by means of rigid fixations such as plates, screws, and rigid intermaxillary blocks in order to minimise any nonunion, malunion, or delayed union of the fracture segments. These surgical procedures are associated with moderate postoperative pain, being the first 24 hours the most intense pain period. Maxillary and mandibular nerve blocks are performed in patients with refractory trigeminal neuralgia. However, there have been few studies evaluating the analgesic effects of these blocks for maxillofacial surgeries."

Such a marker could play a vital role in modern fast-track multimodal protocols, allowing safe and early discharge of patients after colorectal surgery with a low rate of readmission. C-reactive protein (CRP) has been identified as a valid parameter for detection of postoperative infectious complications after rectal resection. A serum CRP level greater than 12.4 mg/dL on postoperative day (POD) 4 is considered predictive of septic complications. According to a recent analysis, the changes in the trajectory of CRP levels might be more beneficial than a snipped point. Moreover, the trajectory has a negative predictability of up to 99.3%. Another interesting biomarker is procalcitonin (PCT), the prohormone of calcitonin, produced by parafollicular C cells in the thyroid. Normally, it has a very low plasma concentration in healthy individuals (0.01-0.05 ng/mL), and it increases during severe generalized bacterial, parasitic, or fungal infections, but not in noninfectious inflammatory reactions. Procalcitonin has been described as an early, sensitive, and specific marker of sepsis. Moreover, the plasma concentration of PCT has been used as an early predictor of infection in acute pancreatitis, secondary peritonitis, and infectious complications after thoracic, esophageal, and cardiac surgeries. In addition, elevated white blood cell (WBC) count is associated with AL after gastrointestinal surgeries. Therefore, this study was conducted to evaluate the utility of CRP, PCT, and WBC count trajectories, as separate and combined biomarkers for prediction of AL after colorectal surgery."

Therefore, flushing this circuit using an appropriate disinfectant to prevent bacterial colonization inside it and thus decreasing pneumonia occurrence has been our crucial investigation idea. Aim: To investigate the effect of suction system flushing with chlorhexidine (CHX) on the occurrence of VAP among mechanically ventilated patients (MVPs). Design: This study adopted a quasi-experimental research design, and a convenience sampling technique was used to recruit 136 patients to conduct this study. Setting: This study was conducted at surgical intensive care units of Mansoura University Emergency Hospital, Egypt. Results: The intervention group patients had a lower incidence of VAP (by 48.12%) compared with the control group. Moreover, the proposed technique was more effective in decreasing the incidence of late-VAP more than early-VAP. Furthermore, CHX reduced the cost of suction system flushing by 75%. Conclusion: Suction system flushing with CHX can significantly reduce the occurrence of VAP among MVPs and reduce the flushing cost. Therefore, this study recommends incorporating CHX into the daily care of MVPs."

A SEER database analysis of 1404 patients with appendiceal adenocarcinoma found that older age, T4 tumors, N1-2 stage, poorly differentiated carcinoma, and distant metastasis were significantly predictive of poorer survival. Another small single-center study including 49 appendiceal cancer patients reported female gender and low-grade adenocarcinoma to be associated with increased overall survival. However, these previous analyses did not take into account some important prognosticators of survival such as patients' comorbidities and functional status, pathologic parameters such as lymphovascular invasion, and adjuvant systemic treatment. Therefore, we used the National Cancer Database (NCDB) to conduct a comprehensive analysis of the predictors of overall survival after surgical treatment of stage I-III appendiceal adenocarcinoma."

In total, 612 undergraduate students completed the survey in Mansoura University. Data collection Data was collected anonymously through an online questionnaire created using the technology of Google Forms provided by Google \u2122 and was constructed in Arabic language. The questionnaire consisted of three sections. The first section assessed students' baseline characteristics including sex, age, area of study, academic level, residence, marital status, family members infected, close people infected, and knowing someone who died of the infection. The second section measured the psychosocial effects of COVID-19 pandemic using two instruments, University of California Los Angeles (UCLA) Loneliness Scale, version 324 and Depression Anxiety Stress Scale (DASS-21).19 The UCLA Loneliness Scale is a widely used self-report instrument of loneliness consisting of 20 items designed to measure both emotional as well as social loneliness. Response of each item was rated on a four-point scale from (1) never to (4) always felt as expressed in each item. Final score ranges from 20 to 80 with higher scores demonstrating higher feelings of loneliness. The scale's reliability was found to be high with alpha coefficients ranging from 0.89 to 0.94 for samples of students. The Arabic version of UCLA Loneliness Scale was used in the current study according to the Arabic translation in Egyptian culture by Daswqee.20 The correlation coefficients values were 0.76 for females and 0.74 for males."

Early diagnosis of AKI can improve clinical outcomes in LT recipients. Renal resistive index is measured in renal arteries and high resistive values are associated with more adverse cardiovascular events and renal failure progression. Myocardial performance index reflects overall cardiac function rather than systolic or diastolic function alone. Aim of the study: to investigate whether combined doppler renal resistive index and myocardial performance index could predict early postoperative acute kidney injury in living donor liver transplant recipients. Study design: a prospective observational study that will be conducted at Liver Transplantation Unit at Mansoura University on 105 consecutive living donor liver transplant recipients. Methods: Renal resistive index (assessed by transabdominal ultrasound) and myocardial performance index (assessed by transthoracic echocardiography) will be measured just before operation, on termination of operation and then daily in the intensive care unit for 7 days. Patients will be observed for development of acute kidney injury."

            "Ectopic fat is the accumulation of adipose tissue in anatomical sites not classically associated with fat storage - for example, in the liver and skeletal muscles. Excessive fat accumulation in liver cells, often diagnosed as non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), is a precursor to a wide range of liver conditions and metabolic disorders. The usual standard of care for NAFLD is to advise weight loss through controlled diet and physical activity, but the outcome of weight management and treatment of NAFLD is highly variable. Diet interventions - such as the Mediterranean, ketogenic, paleo, and high-protein-low-carbohydrate diets - have shown varied benefits in the management of NAFLD. However, food-based interventions must align with cultural and regional preferences in food to succeed in making the modifications part of the habitual diet. A recent diet intervention study (Della Pepa et al., 2020) highlighted that the components of a diet, rather than its caloric content, play a greater role in achieving healthier outcomes. In this study, a multifactorial diet intervention using locally sourced and produced meals will be implemented with the aim of reducing elevated liver fat content in healthy women diagnosed with NAFLD. The study will also evaluate the effects of the proposed diet on the participants' metabolic health and describe potential changes in their gut microbiome signatures (via frequent stool samples). The dysregulation of the gut microbiota has been linked to the development of NAFLD and it is known that the composition of the gut microbiota could be modified by dietary intake. This study will investigate the association of gut microbiome signatures with elevated liver fat in Asian women and test whether the dietary intervention will modify their gut microbiota. Finally, ectopic fat in the liver is a highly prevalent condition worldwide but the cut-off values for NAFLD has been largely derived from studies performed in Western populations. This study seeks to cross examine the diagnostic ranges in various clinical assessments of NAFLD that commonly involve ultrasound spectroscopy (Fibroscan), fatty liver indexes (FLI) and magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS). This effort seeks to derive appropriate cut-off values for NAFLD in Singaporean-Chinese women."

            "Background Anal fissure is one of the most common anorectal problems. After an outbreak of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has rapidly spread from China to almost all over the world, it nearly affected all countries. In spite of its typical presentation in the form of fever, cough, myalgia, fatigue and pneumonia, other GIT manifestations were reported. We found some of COVID-19 survivors who had complained from anal fissure problem. The aim of this study was to report the prevalence of acute anal fissure among COVID-19 patients, its possible risk factors and outcome. Methods This is a retrospective cross-sectional study which was conducted over three months from the start of September 2020 to the end of November 2020 at Mansoura university isolation hospital, on COVID-19 patients' who were diagnosed with anal fissure. Those who survived and were discharged home safely were telephone called to pick up whether they suffered from any symptoms of anal pain, difficulty in defecation suggesting anal fissure, in order to identify their outcomes, the risk factors for anal fissure development and how they were managed. Results A total of 176 patients were enrolled in this study. Patients were categorized into two groups. The first group included patients who developed anal fissure (n=65) and the 2nd group included patients who did not develop anal fissure (n=111). No significant difference was noted in demographic data apart from the age which was younger in the fissure group. The incidence of anal fissure was 36.9% of total population. The majority of patients' anal fissure problem resolved spontaneously after patients improved from the COVID symptoms without receiving any treatment (43.1%). Conclusion Anal fissure is quite common problem after COVID-19. Young and middle age patients are more vulnerable to develop anal fissure after COVID-19 infection."

            "90% of Asian workers report high levels of stress in an \"always-on\" culture. Stress and burnout are risk factors that account for 10-20% of health expenditure and threaten work longevity in the world's fastest growing economies. Traditional face-to-face sources of mental care such as counseling and psychotherapy are effective as a countermeasure to stress, but not always accessible or acceptable for those with busy lifestyles. Because of this, there is an urgent need for on-demand, scalable interventions to reduce stress and improve mental and physical well being. Technology-based solutions are increasingly being proposed to fill this need. MindFi is a smartphone app that uses mindfulness exercises to help users cope with work stress and increase productivity. Since 2017, it has been featured by Apple, BBC, and Bloomberg and is being used at corporates such as Bain, Bloomberg, Cigna, and Zendesk. MindFi users contribute behavioral and self-report data, which are then used to generate individual recommendations for relevant, evidence-based exercises. These include mental care techniques such as mindfulness meditation, therapeutic journaling, psychosocial support and educational wellbeing quizzes. In this study, the investigators will recruit 200 participants in a randomized controlled design, with 100 receiving access to content of the MindFi app, and 100 receiving access to a version containing music tracks for relaxation. Each intervention will last 4 weeks. Participants will use these apps for a period of 5 weeks (for a minimum of 10 minutes per day). Pre- and post-intervention, the investigators will measure self-reported ratings on a number of psychological variables, and will track sleep quality objectively for a one-week period."

            "Hemorrhoids are a common disease in the general population. Its prevalence is estimated to be 5-36 % and more prevalent in western countries . Half of people older than 50 years of age will suffer from hemorrhoids in a period of their life, of which only 5-10% will require surgical intervention while most of the remainders become asymptomatic and improved with the conservative treatment. Conservative treatment in the form of diet modification as well as some medical treatment, is usually effective. On the other hand, a few patients require surgical intervention. Surgery is indicated for those not responding to conservative management, those with grade III, and grade IV hemorrhoids. Surgical treatment is the only curative method for hemorrhoidal disease and indicated for advanced and complicated disease. The most radical operations with the best results are the Milligan-Morgan and Ferguson hemorrhoidectomy . However, the major concern of hemorrhoidectomy is the post-operative pain that occurs in 20-40 % of patients and it is considered the main cause of refusing surgery. The cause of postoperative pain is multifactorial, including the type of anesthesia , hemorrhoidectomy technique. and spasm of the internal anal sphincter (IAS) that becomes exposed after hemorrhoidectomy. The spasm of the IAS is considered the target to relieve pain post operatively. Lateral internal sphincterotomy (LIS) is widely used as an adjunct to relieve pain post hemorrhoidectomy as it release the spasm of the sphincter and subsequently relieve pain. However, this procedure is not accepted by many surgeons due to its recorded complications as bleeding and mild degree of fecal incontinence, so its role following hemorrhoidectomy is still controversial. On the other hand, the spasm of the anal sphincter can be abolished by injection of the botulinum toxin which acts on the acetylcholine receptor and consequently temporary muscle paralysis occurs that is followed by decreased pain and wound healing. Our hypothesis is botulinum toxin relaxes the internal sphincter, so prevent its spasm and so reducing the pain and promoting wound healing more rapidly."

            "Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a leading cause of death and disability in trauma patients. As the primary injury cannot be reversed, management strategies must focus on preventing secondary injury by avoiding hypotension and hypoxia and maintaining appropriate cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP), which is a surrogate for cerebral blood flow (CBF). The goal should be euvolemia and avoidance of hypotension. The assessment of a patient's body fluid status is a challenging task for modern clinicians. The use of Ultrasonography to assess body fluids has numerous advantages. The concept of using lung ultrasound for monitoring the patient is one of the major innovations that emerged from recent studies. Pulmonary congestion may be semiquanti\ufb01ed using lung ultrasound and deciding how the patient tolerates fluid. Inferior vena cava (IVC) sonography and point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) has become widely used as a tool to help clinicians prescribe \ufb02uid therapy. Common POCUS applications that serve as guides to \ufb02uid administration rely on assessments of the inferior vena cava to estimate preload and lung ultrasound to identify the early presence of extravascular lung water and avoid \ufb02uid over resuscitation In this study we will use the measurements of both lung and IVC together to guide fluid dosage in critically ill patients with TBI.

The stones are removed by passing a small telescope through the side of the patient directly into the kidney, so the stone can be broken up and the fragments are removed .PCNL can be performed under general anesthesia or spinal anesthesia. SA has some advantage over GA, such as lower postoperative pain, lower consumption of analgesic drugs and avoidance of side effects from multiple medications used in GA.However, SA induced sympathetic block leads to a decrease in the systemic vascular resistance and subsequent drop in the arterial blood pressure. Furthermore, anesthesia for PCNL usually requires a high sensory level reaching T4,resulting in a high incidence (nearly 33%) of hypotension. Also, to meet the long duration of surgery, drugs, ;like dexmedetomidine, are added to intrathecal local anesthetics , increasing the incidence of hemodynamic instability induced by the spinal anesthesia. Decreasing the systemic vascular resistance (SVR) and the venous return to the heart result in a reflex vasodilation, bradycardia and hypotension. This reflex is called Bezold -Jarisch reflex and is mediated by serotonin receptors (5_HT3) located on the vagus nerve and within the wall of the cardiac ventricles. Ondansetron; an antiemetic drug used for treatment of perioperative nausea and vomiting, was investigated as a 5HT antagonist for inhibition of Bezold - Jarisch reflex.

Three different experimental studies (physical fatigue, mental fatigue and combined) will be performed with a randomized, single-blinded, placebo controlled, counter-balanced, cross-over design. The objectives of the projects are as follows: - To experimentally assess the role of a dopamine, and a noradrenalin reuptake inhibitor in the onset of exercise-induced fatigue - To identify changes in brain activation associated with altered PF and fatigue perception - To experimentally assess the effect of a NA or DA reuptake inhibitor on MF, brain activation and the sources of changes in brain activation - To experimentally assess the role of brain neurotransmitters (DA, NA) in the interaction between mental and PF from a neurophysiological perspective. Participants will be healthy young adults. In each study, they will start with a familiarization trial followed by two experimental trials and one control trial with a randomized treatment order. At each visit, different drugs will be administered to elicit different neurotransmitter response. The trials will be performed at the MFYS exercise lab (BLITS, VUB campus Etterbeek, Boulevard General Jaques 271, 1050 Elsene (Brussels)). Depending on the type of study they are participating in, participants will perform three distinct tasks: - In the first experimental study participants will perform a 60-min Stroop Task to elicit mental fatigue. - In the second experimental study participants will perform a knee-extension exercise until exhaustion to elicit physical fatigue. - In third experimental study participants will first preform a mental fatiguing task (Stroop taks) followed by physical fatigue task (knee extension). While participants will perform above mentioned task their EEG signal and heart rate will be measured. At the same time, participants will report on their subjective feeling of fatigue during these tasks. In addition, all participants will be administered cognitive tasks before and after the study, along with questionnaires. In the second and third experiments, tensiomyography and electromyography will also be recorded from the quadriceps muscle of the leg used for knee extension. Researchers will compare physiological and behavioural changes in response to specific neurotransmitter drug to answer the main question: what the role of a DA and a NA reuptake inhibitor on the onset of mental and physical fatigue is."

            "Temporomandibular joint dysfunction (TMD) is a broad clinical picture involving the TMJ and its disc, masticatory musculature, ligament tissue, and autonomic nervous system (ANS). TMD symptoms include decrease or excessive increase in joint range of motion (ROM), clicking sound or crepitation in the joint, pain around the joint or muscle group, chewing and swallowing problems. Pain caused by MPS, trigger point, fatigue, limitation of ROM, and ANS dysfunction cause TMD. With the inclusion of habits such as clenching and bruxism, pain, spasm and disability develop in the chewing muscles. Exposure to repeated trauma and excessive use of chewing muscles may cause the formation of tight bands and trigger points, which are characterized by MPS. When the relationship between TMD and ANS was examined, it was observed that increased sympathetic activity and decreased parasympathetic activity were effective in the severity of TMD symptoms. Auricular vagus nerve stimulation is a peripheral, non-pharmacological and non-invasive neuromodulation technique that modifies signal processing in the CNS, activates reflex circuits, exploits brain plasticity for different therapeutic purposes, thereby affecting very different areas of the brain. Non-invasive or transcutaneous Vagus Nerve Stimulation delivery systems provide stimulation in the auricular branch of the vagus nerve in the outer ear, thus eliminating the need for surgical implantation. The aim of our study is to reveal the extent to which Auricular Vagus Nerve Stimulation, applied in addition to the conventional rehabilitation program, affects the results of the treatment by stimulating the parasympathetic nervous system in patients with Temporomandibular Joint Dysfunction caused by Myofascial Pain Syndrome."

            "The prevalence of hypertension is greater in older women than men, while the blood pressure (BP) control rate is lower in older women in US. Uncontrolled hypertension is a major risk factor for cardiovascular morbidity/mortality. Despite standard therapy and adherence to optimal drug regimens, >50% of older hypertensive women still have inadequate BP control, and the control rate is further reduced with more aggressive BP targets recommended recently by the new Hypertension Guidelines. Thus, the effectiveness of drug treatment alone in the control of hypertension among older women is limited; hence, non-pharmacological approaches are also needed to help reduce BP in older hypertensive women. One adjuvant, non-pharmacological approach that offers promise in lowering BP is \"heat therapy\". Indeed, repeated whole-body heat exposure decreases BP in healthy humans. Whether this is also true after regional limb heating in hypertensive patients is unknown. The objectives of this research are to investigate the BP lowering effect of home-based lower leg heat therapy in older women with hypertension, and to examine the impact of this therapeutic modality on neural-vascular health in these patients. Aim 1 will test the hypothesis that chronic lower leg heat therapy combined with an antihypertensive drug is superior to drug treatment alone in lowering BP in older hypertensive women. We will randomly assign older hypertensive women to either an intervention group or a control group. Patients in the intervention group will perform 8 weeks of lower leg heat therapy via water immersion up to the knee in a circulated bath (water temperature 42\u00b0C, 4 times/week, 45 min/session), whereas patients in the control group will immerse their legs in a thermoneutral water bath (33\u00b0C) at the same frequency and duration. All patients will also receive a fixed dose of chlorthalidone (a diuretic, 25 mg orally daily). We will compare ambulatory BP, the BP control rate, and patient adherence and acceptability to treatment between the groups. Aim 2 will test the hypothesis that chronic lower leg heat therapy will improve nitric oxide bioavailability which can decrease sympathetic vasoconstriction and improve vascular function in older hypertensive women. We will use state-of-the-art techniques of microneurography, Doppler ultrasound, applanation tonometry, and cutaneous microdialysis to assess neural control, vasodilator function, and interstitial metabolites (i.e. nitrate and nitrite) indicative of basal nitric oxide bioavailability in all patients enrolled in Aim 1 before and after 8 weeks of heat therapy. Information obtained from this research project will guide evidence-based clinical practice. It is anticipated that our study may lead to revision of hypertension guidelines to incorporate home-based heat therapy as adjuvant to antihypertensive drug(s) for older women, as well as other patient populations."

            "While the association of physical and/or motor and/or cognitive components with training can generate synergistic effects and thus create an efficient cognitive enrichment program, very few studies have focused on finding an optimal combined program for older adults. According to the model of Herold and his colleagues, there are two modalities of simultaneous combined training: Thinking While Moving (TwM), when the additional cognitive task is not linked to the motor task, and Moving While Thinking (MwT), when the cognitive task is integrated into the motor task. They assume the latter approach is the most promising for improving cognitive reserve. Nevertheless, to the investigators' knowledge, only one study has compared these two modalities in older adults and none has broadened the question by comparing several MwT trainings. The goal of this interventional study will be to compare the cognitive, dual-task, and physical effects of 6 physical and/or cognitive programs in healthy but inactive older adults. The main questions it will aims to answer are: - Will the Moving While Thinking and Thinking While Moving programs have the same effects? - If they have different effects, which will be the best way to improve cognitive, dual-task, and physical functions? The study is being set up between 2023 and 2025 to compare the cognitive, dual- ask and physical effects of 6 programs (3 months, 2 sessions of 1 hour per week).

            "Community service providers (CSPs), such as promotores and other community health staff, play an essential role in preserving health and treating disease in underserved Hispanic/Latinx (HL) communities with disproportionately high rates of cardiometabolic (CM) disease. Although effective programs have been developed that deploy CSPs to reduce CM disease risk in the community, to our knowledge no interventions have sought to reduce CM risk among CSPs themselves. However, CSPs are also at high risk for adverse CM outcomes, as they have the same high-risk demographics as the communities they serve and they work in high-stress, frontline jobs. Reducing CM risk among HL CSPs is crucial to promote health at both the individual and community levels; that is, preventive interventions delivered to CSPs may not only promote the health of the individual CSPs who receive the intervention but also may bolster CSPs to more effectively deliver programming that protects CM health community-wide. The proposed study employs relational savoring (RS), a brief intervention rooted in positive psychology and attachment, which has previously been shown to promote psychosocial well-being and which is particularly efficacious in HL populations. Emerging research supports that RS may also promote more optimal cardiovascular regulation and health behavior. Therefore, the investigators deliver RS to CSPs in order to identify CM health protective effects for both CSPs and the high-risk communities they serve. Aims and Hypotheses: Aim 1: Examine effects of RS on CSPs' CM risk factors and outcomes. Hypotheses: RS (compared to wait-list control) will be associated with lower CM risk, as indexed by higher mean HRV, both during a stressor and at rest (H1A). RS will also be associated with a more favorable CM health behavior profile, indexed by higher quality sleep, more exercise, and healthier diet (H1B). Aim 2: Examine effects of RS on CSPs' delivery of CM health programming to the community. Hypotheses: RS will be associated both with reduced threats to CSPs leaving the workforce, including higher satisfaction with work, greater agency, and lower burnout (H2A), and with a higher number of community members reached for CM health programming, as indexed by number of days CSP worked, number of health-related events offered by CSPs, community attendance at events, and retention of community members across multi-day programs (H2B)."

            "Sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) is among the most prevalent chronic conditions in aging and has a profoundly negative effect on speech comprehension, leading to increased social isolation, reduced quality of life, and increased risk for the development of dementia in older adulthood. Typical audiological tests and interventions, which focus on measuring and restoring audibility, do not explain the full range of cognitive difficulties that adults with hearing loss experience in speech comprehension. For example, adults with SNHL have to work disproportionally harder to decode acoustically degraded speech. That additional effort is thought to diminish shared executive and attentional resources for higher-level language processes, impacting subsequent comprehension and memory, even when speech is completely intelligible. This phenomenon has been referred to as listening effort (LE). There is a growing understanding that these cognitive factors are a critical and often \"hidden effect\" of hearing loss. At the same time, the effects of LE on the neural mechanisms of language processing and memory in SNHL are currently not well understood. In order to develop evidence-based assessments and interventions to improve comprehension and memory in SNHL, it is critical that we elucidate the cognitive and neural mechanisms of LE and its consequences for speech comprehension. In this project, we adopt a multi-method approach, combining methods from clinical audiology, psycholinguistics, and cognitive neuroscience to address this gap of knowledge. Specifically, we adopt a novel and innovative method of co-registering pupillometry (a reliable physiological measure of LE) and language-related event-related brain potential (ERP) measures during real-time speech processing to characterize the effects of acoustic challenge and LE on high-level language processes (e.g., semantic retrieval, syntactic integration) and subsequent speech memory in older adults with SNHL. This innovative work addresses a time-sensitive gap in the literature regarding the identification of objective and reliable markers of specific neurocognitive processes impacted by acoustic challenge and LE in age-related SNHL."

            "The Effects of High Intensity Circuit Training in Nature Vs. Indoor on Exercise Performance, and Wellbeing",
            "Exercising in a nature setting has been credited with benefits for health and well-being, more so than exercising indoors. Additionally, motoric performance in the same exercise (e.g., running speed, more strenuous physical activity) has been reported in some studies to be greater if practiced outdoors, in a nature setting. The explanation may be in the inherent variability of natural landscapes, the textures, elevations, obstacles and objects which are not found in standard built and indoor settings. Indoor settings are characterized by safe, organized, patterned textures and objects created for specific ends, which inhibit variability in physical and physiological behavior. Variability in the environment turns into variability in body systems, which benefits health, well-being, and skill acquisition. Variability in behavior depends also on the task. Running or walking is essentially a journey throughout the environment in which interaction with obstacles, puddles, and other runners is part of the variability of the activity. On the other hand, physical activity such as HICT is done in a small area, and is a scripted, prescribed activity (e.g., push-ups, sit-ups), which lowers the amount of variability in behavior. The aim of this trial is to test if a low variability activity shows differences in performance, wellbeing, and behavior measures according to the amount of variability in the environment. In this trial the participants will engage in two high intensity circuit training (HICT) interventions - one in an indoor setting, and another in a nature setting. The HICT intervention includes 12 calisthenic exercises, and will be performed at a self-selected intensity by the participants. Each exercise will be performed during one minute, followed by 30 seconds of rest where the participants will be instructed what the next exercise will be. Before exercising, the participants put a heart rate monitor and two inertial measurement units (IMUs) on the right arm and leg, according to the correct usage guidelines, and rate their positive affect, arousal, and perceived exertion. Immediately after exercising, they rate the same measures again. Research Hypotheses: Greater movement variability, heart rate variability, performance, wellbeing, and arousal during HICT in nature setting than indoor setting."

            "The current COVID-19 pandemic is the most severe health crisis of the 21st century. This is not only due to the deaths caused by the disease. People that were affected by COVID-19 and supposedly recovered may suffer from long lasting sequelae. The presence of symptoms longer than 3 months after the infection with SARS-CoV-2 is referred to as Post-COVID-19 Syndrome or Long COVID-19. It is estimated that 10-20 percent of all infected people are affected. The most common symptoms include persistent fatigue, reduced physical capacity, dyspnoea, ageusia, anosmia, musculoskeletal pain and neuropsychological complaints such as depression, anxiety, insomnia and a loss of concentration. Considering the novelty of the pathology, evidence on the successful treatment of Post-COVID/Long-COVID is scarce. Physical activity has been established as a treatment option for chronic diseases that have similar symptomatic manifestations to those of Post-COVID/Long-COVID. For example, exercise therapy has shown positive effects on the health status of patients with lung disease, depression, anxiety, insomnia and cognitive impairment. However, there has been controversy whether so-called Graded Exercise Therapy (GET) is a safe treatment strategy for patients with Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (CFS). This population may experience Post Exertional Malaise (PEM), a worsening of symptoms after physical, cognitive or emotional exertion. Since COVID-19 might be an infectious trigger for CFS, particular caution has to be taken when recruiting participants and when screening them for adverse events and worsening of symptoms during an exercise intervention. It can be hypothesized that patients suffering from Post-COVID/Long-COVID can benefit from exercise in various ways, guaranteed that there is sufficient screening for PEM before and during the intervention and training volume and intensity are increased slowly and progressively. The current study investigates the effects of two different training modalities, endurance training and a combination of endurance training and resistance training, on various parameters in people affected by Post-COVID/Long-COVID."

The strain of providing care for a loved one diagnosed with AD, often across several years, is associated with elevated depression risk and poorer overall health. Emotion regulation skills represent an ideal target for psychological intervention to promote healthy coping in ADRD caregivers. The project seeks to use an experimental medicine approach to test the efficacy and biobehavioral mechanisms of a novel, relatively brief, targeted, scalable, smartphone-based cognitive emotion regulation intervention aimed at improving psychological outcomes (i.e., reducing perceived stress, caregiver burden, and depressive symptoms) in ADRD unpaid primary caregivers as well as examine potential benefits of the caregiver intervention on quality of life in care recipients. Cognitive reappraisal is the ability to modify the trajectory of an emotional response by thinking about and appraising emotional information in an alternative, more adaptive way. Reappraisal can be operationalized via two primary tactics: psychological distancing (i.e. appraising an emotional stimulus as an objective, impartial observer) and reinterpretation (i.e., imagining a better outcome than what initially seemed apparent). The project will investigate the efficacy and underlying biobehavioral mechanisms of a novel, one-week cognitive reappraisal intervention in this population, with follow-up assessments at 2 weeks, 4 weeks, and 3 months. ADRD unpaid primary caregivers will be randomly assigned to receive training in either distancing, reinterpretation, or a no regulation natural history control condition, with ecological momentary assessments of self-reported positive and negative affect, remotely- collected psychophysiological health-related biomarkers (i.e., heart rate variability data) using pre-mailed Polar H10 chest bands, and health-related questionnaire reports. Distancing training is expected to result in longitudinal reductions in self-reported negative affect, longitudinal increases in positive affect, and longitudinal increases in HRV that are larger than those attributable to reinterpretation training and no-regulation control training."

Its goals are to minimize abdominal incisions and postoperative pain and to prevent incisional complications, such as incisional hernias and adhesions. Compared with open procedures, MIS is associated with faster recovery times, better patient quality of life, and lower postoperative complication rates. The removal of an adnexal mass from the abdominal cavity is performed most commonly using the suprapubic, umbilical, or vaginal route. Apart from these, mini laparoscopy can provide a better cosmetic result without additional operative time or complications. Despite the limited use of mini laparoscopy for gynecological procedures, its use has increased recently. After excision, an adnexal mass can be removed through a laparoscopic (LS) port using a variety of endoscopic or containment bags. After the mass has been placed in it, the bag is withdrawn, closed, and expelled through the skin incision with simultaneous trocar removal. When a mass is large or cannot be removed through the port, the incision may be enlarged slightly. This situation may yield a cosmetically worse outcome and increases the risk of postoperative complications, such as adhesion, hernia, and increased postoperative pain. Thus, natural orifice surgery (NOS) has emerged for tissue removal in such cases.

Moreover, a control group (n=30) will be included to evaluate the effect of any type of intervention versus no intervention. Data collection will be performed at baseline and 15-week of follow-up. Socio-demographic data, medication, comorbidity, blood biochemical parameters, blood pressure, anthropometric measurements, body composition, physical activity, sedentary lifestyle, diet, smoking, alcohol consumption, quality of life and sleep questionnaires will be collected.

            "Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), an invisible wound of war, affects approximately 20%1 of the 18.5 million U.S. veterans and places them at higher risk for impaired biopsychosocial functioning. PTSD symptom severity (PTSDSS) is significantly correlated with stress and psychosocial consequences of inability to regulate emotions, control impulsive behaviors, and function within family and society. Alarming veteran PTSD rates and its insidious effects demand empirically validated treatment programs. More than a million veterans receive new diagnoses of each year. VA PTSD therapy programs reach only 1% of veterans. Nearly 35% of veterans do not respond to widely used psychotherapy and pharmacotherapy treatments. Training a service dog (SD) is a novel rehabilitative animal-assisted intervention that shows promise in other populations. This project evaluates the efficacy of a service dog training program (SDTP) as an alternative and adjunctive treatment and rehabilitative option for veterans with PTSD."

            "Post-Covid syndrome is defined as symptoms that develop in addition to respiratory symptoms in individuals who have had Covid-19 infection for more than 12 weeks. Symptoms such as fatigue, headache, cognitive impairment, dyspnea, heart palpitations, heat intolerance, digestive system disorders, sleep disorders, dermal problems, orthostatic intolerance come to the fore in individuals with post-Covid syndrome. It has been tried to be revealed in some studies that Covid-19 infection affects the autonomic nervous system (ANS) and the relationship between Post-Covid 19 syndrome and ANS dysfunction. Heart rate variability (HRV) measurement method can be used to evaluate ANS activity. HRV is a non-invasive method and is a measure of the change in heart rate over a period of time. HRV is a scalar quantity that shows the time between two beats of the heart and defines the oscillations between the R-R intervals. In HRV measurements, time-dependent and frequency-dependent measurement results are obtained and from these measurements, time-dependent RMSSD (square root of the square of the difference of the R-R intervals) and frequency-dependent high-frequency (HF) and low frequency (LF) measurement components are used in relation to the sympathetic nervous system (CNS) and parasympathetic nervous system (PSS). HRV can be measured in short-term (5 minutes) in terms of measurement time. The aim of this study is to clearly reveal the relationship between Post-Covid 19 syndrome and ANS dysfunction and to provide standardization related to HRV measurement method and sub-parameters."

Methods: parallel, randomised, controlled, clinical trial will be carried out, with a total of 90 participants. Exercise modality that showed the best glycaemic control in first phase of GLYCEX study (NCT05612698) will be used. Participantds will be randomised in 3 groups: 1) frequency of 5 days/week, 2) frequency of 3 days/week and 3) frequency of 2 days/week. Data collection will be performed at baseline and after 15-weeks of follow up. Sociodemographic data, medication, comorbidity, blood biochemical parameters, blood pressure, anthropometric measurements, body composition, physical activity, sedentary lifestyle, diet, smoking, alcohol consumption, quality of life and sleep questionnaires will be collected. Physical activity, sedentary behaviour and sleep will be further determined with an accelerometer, and continuous glycaemia will be determined with a glycaemic monitor, both during seven days, in two time points. The main dependent variable will be the reduction of the mean amplitude of glycaemic excursions. The impact of the interventions on health will also be evaluated through gene expression analysis in peripheral blood cells. Discussion: The results of this study will contribute to better understanding of the response of glucose mechanisms to physical exercise in a population with prediabetes as well as improving physical exercise prescriptions for diabetes prevention. Increasing glycaemic control in people with prediabetes through physical exercise offers an opportunity to prevent diabetes and reduce associated comorbidities and health costs."

The HR is an important measure to determine the recommended exercise training intensity and to monitor the training intensity in patients with cardiac diseases. The target exercise training intensity during cardiac rehabilitation is between 40% to 70% of heart rate reserve (HRR). Also, cardiac patients who have hypoxemia are advised to continuously monitor their Spo2. Therefore, this study aims to investigate the accuracy of the Apple Watch in measuring the HR and Spo2 in Saudi patients with cardiac diseases. Method: A cross sectional study will be invited one-hundred cardiac patients will be invited and recruited to participate in this study and the eligible participants will be randomly allocated into two groups. The first group (Group-A) will include the cardiac patients with regular HR and the second group (Group-B) will include the cardiac patients with irregular HR. Both groups will use the apple watch to evaluate the HR and the Spo2 against the Polar HR monitor and pulse oximeter at rest, during, and after the mild to moderate intensity exercise training session (40% to 70% HRR). The HR and the Spo2 monitoring, and recording will run on a 30 second schedule at rest (pre-session; for 3-minutes), during the 15-minutes session and over 5-minutes after the session).

Common symptoms include fatigue, shortness of breath, and cognitive dysfunction, among others, and result in an impact on daily functioning. Symptoms may be new onset, appear after initial recovery from an acute episode of COVID-19, or persist after the initial illness. Cardiac variability (HRV) was initially used in COVID-19 to predict mortality in the acute setting. Dysautonomia which partly evaluates HRV is frequent in patients with persistent COVID. Several groups have used voice or other respiratory noise analysis for the diagnosis of acute COVID. Patients in the persistent COVID cohort will be able to be differentiated from an age, sex and vaccination status matched cohort of recovered COVID patients without sequelae by means of a model created by Machine Learning that will be trained using cardiac variability (HRV), skin conductance and acoustic analysis data. The primary objetive will be to obtain a classification algorithm by Machine Learning to differentiate the group of patients with persistent COVID diagnosis from the paired group of recovered COVID patients without sequelae."

PKEP is a safe and effective procedure for the treatment of bladder obstruction secondary to BPH. This procedure not only improves maximum flow rate at 3 and 12 months after surgery, but it also improves all other recorded parameters (IPSS, QOL, IEFF-5, PVR, PSA).

            "Autologous Platelet-Rich-Plasma (PRP) represents a regenerative therapy that has gained remarkable ground in the field of orthopaedics in recent years. PRP has been implemented for a plethora of musculoskeletal ailments, being associated with minor complications and noteworthy efficacy (Akeda et al., 2019). PRP has been depicted to contain a variety of growth factors crucial for regulation of cell proliferation and migration as well as extracellular matrix synthesis (Cheng et al., 2019). Furthermore, therapeutic effect of PRP administration is considered to be additionally exerted via its anti-inflammatory and immunoregulative properties, as it has been delineated to induce regional decrease of pro-inflammatory mediators at the injection site (Hirase et al., 2020). Lumbar Degenerative Disc Disease (DDD) and Facet Joint Syndrome (FJS) constitute chronic degenerative conditions of lumbar spine that have been associated with substantial morbidity and disability in recent years. Besides the noted progress in comprehension of these conditions' pathogenesis, available therapeutic modalities remain extremely limited and controversial, being not capable of altering the natural progress of underlying disease (Wu et al., 2016; Wu et al., 2017; Hirase et al., 2020). Autologous PRR has been recommended as a beneficial alternative instead of conventional treatment strategies for interventional management of lumbar DDD and FJS (Aufiero et al., 2015; Navani and Hames, 2015; Kirchner and Anitua, 2016; Levi et al., 2016; Tuakli-Wosornu et al., 2016; Wu et al., 2016; Akeda et al., 2017; Lutz GE, 2017; Wu et al., 2017; Cheng et al., 2019). Results of these studies indicated that intra-discal and intra-articular injection of PRP for DDD and FJS respectively is characterized by safety and satisfactory efficacy in reducing intensity of clinical manifestations, exerting also potentially regenerative effects. However, quality of available evidence is remarkably low, since in the overwhelming majority of these studies was a limited number of patients evaluated. Furthermore, determined follow-up intervals were not extended and, most importantly, patients were not majorly with rigorous clinical and radiologic criteria selected. Aim of this study is to investigate the precise effects of intradiscal and intra-articular injection of PRP in patients with early-stage lumbar DDD and FJS, as determined by particular radiologic classifications. The prospective design, the defined greater number of recruited individuals in pilot analysis as well as the comparatively greater follow-up underline the originality of our protocol."

However, there is a paucity of research evidence on the effectiveness of using BFR during aerobic exercise. Most BFR interventions have used BFR cuffs in two to four limbs, however, it is unknown if using BFR cuffs in a single limb instead of multiple limbs can produce the desired outcomes in muscle physiology and muscular adaptations. Therefore, we have divided the purpose of this study into the following three aims: Compare physical performance measures of balance, isokinetic muscle strength, knee stability, and aerobic capacity between cycling exercise with and without BFR. Compare physical performance measures between performing cycling exercise at 60% versus 80% blood flow occlusion. Compare physical performance measures between bilateral BFR versus single-leg BFR during a cycling protocol. These aims will be accomplished by randomizing 55 participants into five groups of eleven participants each: 1) control; 2) bilateral BFR cuffs with 60% occlusion; 3) bilateral BFR cuffs with 80% occlusion; 4) single-limb BFR with 60% occlusion; and 5) single-limb BFR with 80% occlusion.

Mobile health (mHealth) interventions can be effective tools to promote physical activity and reduce sedentary behavior. Promising results have been obtained by using gamification techniques as behavior change strategies, especially when they were tailored toward an individual's preferences and goals; yet, it remains unclear how goals could be personalized to effectively promote health behaviors. Objective: In this study, the investigators aim to evaluate the impact of personalized goal setting in the context of gamified mHealth interventions. The investigators hypothesize that interventions suggesting health goals that are tailored based on end users' (self-reported) current and desired capabilities will be more engaging than interventions with generic goals. Methods: The study was designed as a 2-arm randomized intervention trial. Participants were recruited among staff members of Noorderkempen governmental organization. They participated in an 8-week digital health promotion campaign that was especially designed to promote walks, bike rides, and sports sessions. Using an mHealth app, participants could track their performance on two social leaderboards: a leaderboard displaying the individual scores of participants and a leaderboard displaying the average scores per organizational department. The mHealth app also provided a news feed that showed when other participants had scored points. Points could be collected by performing any of the 6 assigned tasks (eg, walk for at least 2000 m). The level of complexity of 3 of these 6 tasks was updated every 2 weeks by changing either the suggested task intensity or the suggested frequency of the task. The 2 intervention arms-with participants randomly assigned-consisted of a personalized treatment that tailored the complexity parameters based on participants' self-reported capabilities and goals and a control treatment where the complexity parameters were set generically based on national guidelines. Measures were collected from the mHealth app as well as from intake and posttest surveys and analyzed using hierarchical linear models.

            "Although there have been major advances in (personalized) stroke treatment in the last decade, the need for prevention of stroke remains critical. Prevention of recurrent stroke is currently primarily organized through management of cardiovascular risk factors including lifestyle, hypertension and atrial fibrillation (AF). To improve the cardiovascular risk management of stroke patients, more frequent measurements of blood pressure and heart rhythm are essential. In addition, actively engaging the patient with their own recovery could lead to an improved lifestyle. Recent studies have shown telemonitoring of patients can improve care, help with prevention of disease, and reduce healthcare costs, whilst keeping the patient more engaged with their disease. The LUMC \"Box\" has shown to effectively monitor blood pressure of patients after myocardial infarction with equal results and patient satisfaction rates compared to standard care with less physical contact moments. We plan to use this framework for improving post-stroke care by introducing more frequent blood pressure and heart rhythm measurements. Additionally, we will provide more information around lifestyle improvement and have the patient actively engage with their weight and physical activity. In this study we will be evaluating the technical feasibility and clinical implementation of the home-based self-measurements using the Box in a post-stroke pilot setting: the Stroke Box. The results will be used as a basis for the power calculation for a future randomized clinical trial on the effect of the BOX on hypertension treatment and AF detection."

Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) remains the treatment of choice but its effectiveness remains limited, especially in reducing cardio-metabolic risk. Interventions to modify the lifestyle are therefore recommended in the management of OSA. The emergence of information and communication technologies is an opportunity for patients to have tools that promote self-management and behavioral changes. The recent development of telerehabilitation (TR) is a promising approach that has only been the subject of pilot studies. In a randomized, controlled and multicenter study, we propose to test the hypothesis according to which the use of a mobile TR solution, associated with continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP), will allow obese patients to adopt behavioral modifications to improve markers of severity of OSA.

Overwhelming numbers of AAs, a fast-growing first-generation immigrant group, suffer from type 2 diabetes (T2D) and its consequences of poorly controlled blood glucose. For the older AAs, there are higher prevalence rates, worse diabetes control, and higher rates of complications due to limited English proficiency and health literacy. Despite the evidence concerning the effects of dietary interventions on glycemic control by well-controlled feeding studies in mainstream Americans, a lack of clinical trials of culturally tailored interventions often imposes serious barriers to translate and implement such fruitful and innovative approaches in individuals from ethnic minority communities such as AAs. The proposed study will use a randomized, controlled design with a sample of 60 AAs aged 65 years or older. Metabolomics methodologies will be incorporated into this research to provide a global picture of metabolites' responses to personalized behavioral nutrition (PBN) intervention.

            "The incidence of postoperative atrial fibrillation (POAF) after on-pump cardiac surgery remains high, at around 30%. POAF increases the risk of cardiac decompensation, stroke, acute myocardial infarction, and death, resulting in increased morbidity and mortality, hospital length of stay, and cost of patient management. Episodes of POAF are usually paroxysmal and asymptomatic, increasing the risk of developing permanent AF at five years by 4 to 5 times. POAF occurs between 3 and 4 days after cardiac surgery, mainly when the patient is hospitalized in a surgical ward without heart rate monitoring as opposed to critical care, where the patient benefits from continuous rhythmic monitoring. The diagnosis of POAF is therefore made with the help of a 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) when the patient presents clinical symptoms and when the medical staff notes a significant variation in heart rate. However, many patients with episodes of asymptomatic POAF have a higher risk of stroke and mortality than those with symptomatic POAF. Faced with this public health problem, the development of tools for diagnosing AF is in full swing, mainly the marketing of smartwatches (SWs) that allow for the performance of 1-lead ECG. SW is also equipped with algorithms to analyze heart rate variability and diagnose asymptomatic atrial fibrillation (AF) episodes. The European Society of Cardiology (ESC) and the European Association for Cardio-Thoracic Surgery (EACTS) recommend the use of smartwatches to detect AF, in particular, to reduce the economic impact of AF. The aim of the study is to diagnose POAF within the first five days after patient discharge from the critical care unit for the cardiac surgery department."

The individual disease course ranges from mild to life threatening, the pandemic spread leads to a shortage of health care resources including intensive care availability. It should be the overarching goal to allocate sparse health care resources to those most at need and to simultaneously avoid unnecessary blocking of resources by clinically unjustified hospitalizations. Individuals with preexisting cardiovascular conditions are at the highest risk of health deterioration, even at younger age. Objective criteria for hospitalization are not immediately available in a outpatient settings. Hence, hospitalization and emergency medical contact is often triggered by subjectively interpreted symptoms. The goal of this project is thus to improve the availability of objective measurements in the outpatient setting by means of an innovative, smartwatch mediated telemedicine approach. To achieve this goal, the investigators will conduct a randomized clinical trial comparing a smartwatch based telemedicine intervention with standard of care. The intervention group will receive regular objective measurements of heart rate, ECG, and SpO2 and will get access to a 24/7 medical care hotline for consultation. The investigators hypothesize that the intervention group will benefit by a significant reduction in unnecessary hospitalizations and unplanned emergency medicine contacts."

There have been some studies which show that when people take their own health readings, they are better able to control their disease, stay healthier and go to the doctor less often. In order to participate in the study participants will have been diagnosed with 1 or more of the following: Diabetes, Hypertension, Cardiac Arrhythmias. This study is designed to test those devices and see if they can help participants stay healthier through the recording and tracking of health measurements.

            "The benefits of physical activity and adequate sleep are well documented, and their importance strengthens with the increasing prevalence of chronic diseases and multimorbidity. Interventions to promote physical activity and sleep that use commercial activity trackers may be useful non-pharmacological approaches to managing individual health; however, limited evidence exists on their use to improve physical activity in elderly patients with multimorbidity. This study aims to measure the effects of behavioral change techniques (BCTs) delivered by a wearable device on physical activity (PA) and quality of sleep (QS) in elderly patients with multimorbidity. The investigators designed an open-label randomized controlled trial with participants recruited through primary care and a specialist outpatient clinic. Participants must be more than 65 years old, have multimorbidity, and have access to smartphones. All eligible participants will receive PA promotion content and will be randomly assigned to wear a smartwatch. The primary outcome will be the participants' PA measurement at six months using the IPAQ-SF. Secondary outcomes will include changes in the participants' frailty status, biometric measurements, quality of life, and biopsychosocial assessments. A sample size of 40 participants per arm was calculated to detect group differences, with 50 participants recruited and randomized into each arm. This study aims to contribute to a better understanding of PA patterns and the impact of smartwatch-based PA interventions in patients with multimorbidity. The trial's findings are expected to improve our understanding of how physical activity patterns, patient-reported outcomes (PROMs), and healthcare resource utilization are linked in patients with multiple medical conditions. The study will use a registry for locally developed PROMs and data from the participants' medical records to determine how wearable data and medical information data can be used to predict PROMs and unplanned hospital admissions."

To this end, an observational study of qualitative and quantitative data collection through cameras, contact recording technologies (gold standards) and questionnaires has been proposed. Based on these data, the specific objectives of this study are as follows: - To determine the differences according to the factors analysed. - Develop/fine-tune algorithms/AI models to obtain quality rPPG/rBCG signals. - Fine-tune models to obtain the main vital signs as HR, RR, SpO2 and BP from image-based-data. The dataset (namely Freyja/IBV-Dataset) is composed of 73 subjects (35 females and 38 males) with ages ranging from 18 to 85, representation in the 6 skin phototypes according to the Fitzpatrick scale (1), and BMI ranging from 15 to 40. In order to determine the sample size, specific ranges have been defined for each of the intrinsic subject factors and all possible combinations have been covered. The number of subjects defined for each combination was based on the percentage it represents in the Spanish population according to the INE (Instituto Nacional de Estad\u00edstica). The subjects will be recruited through the own databases of participants in previous trials of the Institute of Biomechanics of Valencia, who have given written consent to be contacted in order to request their participation in any other study where their profile may fit. The surveys will be included in an online platform specialized in the realization of questionnaires. This data will be exported for further storage, management and analysis. All information will be anonymized for processing and analysis, and may be used under the terms and conditions dictated by the current legal framework. To participate in the study, participants must accept the terms and conditions included in the first page of the survey embedded in the online platform, where the aspects related to the study methodology and the use of them data are exposed."

            "The investigators are testing a two-group, randomized, controlled trial with 280 primary caregivers of adult patients with a chronic illness to test the efficacy of the Rural Intervention for Caregivers' Heart Health (RICHH). Immediate (4-month) and long-term (12-month) effects of the RICHH intervention on CVD risk factors, self-management behaviors, and depressive symptoms will be compared to usual care. The investigators also will test the moderating effect of gender on intervention outcomes, given the many differences between male and female caregivers. Specific Aim 1: To determine effects of the RICHH intervention on the primary outcomes of CVD risk factors (i.e., lipid profile, body mass index, and blood pressure) at 4 and 12 months. Hypotheses 1: The intervention group will have better lipid profile, body mass index, and blood pressure outcomes than the usual care group at 4 and 12 months. Specific Aim 2: To determine effects of the RICHH intervention on self-management behaviors (i.e., diet quality, physical activity level, and self-report adherence to specific CVD health behaviors). Hypotheses 2: The intervention group will have better diet quality, higher physical activity levels, and better adherence to specific CVD health behaviors than the usual care group at 4 and 12 months. Specific Aim 3: To determine effects of RICHH on depressive symptoms at 4 and 12 months. Hypotheses 3: Caregivers receiving the intervention will have lower levels of depressive symptoms than caregivers receiving usual care at 4 and 12 months. Specific Aim 4: To evaluate whether intervention effects on outcomes will differ by caregivers' gender. Hypotheses 4: Effects will be stronger for male compared to female caregivers at 4 and 12 months. Impact: The proposed study will have a substantial impact on caregivers' cardiovascular health and quality of life because it will provide needed CVD risk prevention, and health promotion to rural caregivers living in distressed environments where CVD risk reduction and self-management is difficult. The intervention holds the potential to produce major improvements in health among caregivers living in rural environments in the US."

The objective of this cohort study is to demonstrate the effectiveness of the RNPC program on the reduction of drug or instrumental treatments (for example, continuous positive pressure ventilation for the treatment of sleep apnea syndrome) and the improvement of overweight/obesity-associated comorbidities in the medium term. This is a multicenter clinical study, as part of routine care, with standardized nutritional care (RNPC Program) in all RNPC centers in France. A cohort will be formed based on the clinical and biological data usually collected in the centers, enriched by data from additional clinical and biological examinations as well as by self-questionnaires completed by the participants. About 10,000 overweight or obese participants will be included for 2 years and followed 5 years. The SCOOP-RNPC study will have benefits for individual participants, for the scientific community in terms of knowledge acquired and for society with a better definition of the impact of treatments. Responding to the major public health issue represented by overweight, this prospective cohort of overweight or obese patients will make it possible to evaluate, in real-life conditions, the effects of weight loss obtained by the RNPC Program in the short, medium and long term on biological parameters predictive of cardiometabolic risk, drug consumption, quality of life, diet and eating behavior, sleep, physical activity, stress/anxiety, as well as depression. This cohort will make it possible to identify clinical phenotypes and biomarkers to optimize the personalization of the management of overweight or obese patients, in particular those at risk of developing comorbidities associated with excess weight."

            "Digital Biotyping of FSHD Patients and Controls",
            "Facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (FSHD) is a devastating progressive muscle dystrophy. There is no treatment. FSHD is generally characterized by asymmetrical weakness and wasting of facial, shoulder girdle and upper arm muscles followed by weakness of muscles of the trunk and lower extremities, but disease severity varies widely between patients. Relatively long periods of stability are interspersed with short periods of potentially steep decline, leading overall to a slow but unpredictable rate of progression. Different genotypes underlying FSHD have been identified, but they result in highly similar phenotypes and at the molecular level converge on undue expression of the transcription factor, DUX4, in skeletal muscle, which is thought to (ultimately) lead to muscle wasting due to inflammation, apoptosis, and oxidative stress. There is no approved treatment, although various companies are engaged in FSHD drug discovery and development aimed in particular at reducing DUX4 expression. Multiple treatment options are currently under development in both preclinical and early clinical stages. However, these efforts face significant challenges in the path to regulatory approval. Because of the slow and variable rate of progression of FSHD, evidencing a significant treatment response will be cumbersome using only the existing measurements of muscle function. The successful development of these investigative treatments for FSHD is therefore highly dependent on the availability of validated disease and treatment biomarkers to monitor disease progression and response to treatment, respectively. To date, no such validated biomarkers exist. This study is important for four reasons: 1. Clinical testing of FSHD drug candidates requires the availability of clinical biomarkers that (a) change relatively rapidly over time; (b) allow for identification of fast progressors; and (c) correlate with \"gold standard\", but slowly changing, clinical severity and/or functional scores. This study is a first step in that direction as it seeks to explore if the investigational digital technologies described below are able to generate single or composite variables that (cross-sectionally) distinguish FSHD patients from controls. If identified, such variables will be tested as putative clinical FSHD biomarkers in a follow-up longitudinal study with FSHD patients. 2. Patient testimonies indicate that living with FSHD means living with pain, fatigue, social isolation, and anxiety about the future. This study provides the first-ever opportunity to gather objective, real-world data about the impact of FSHD on daily life. 3. Regulators have already indicated that Real-World Data (RWD) is a top strategic priority for their drug reviews. This study aims to fill this gap by gathering RWD about the physical and social activities of FSHD patients in comparison with controls. This way we aim to find (composite) scores that correlate with selected severity and functional scores and additionally distinguish FSHD patients from controls. 4. This study offers an opportunity to expand the spectrum of diseases in which RWD may be used as (a basis for) clinical outcome measures. A successful outcome of this study may support testing the MORE platform in other muscular dystrophies as well."

            "Adherence to CPAP determines the expected benefits of the treatment. A dose-benefit relationship has been demonstrated for both functional and cardiovascular benefits. The first few days' use of the device are decisive in determining long-term compliance. In this context, daily monitoring of the data teletransmitted means that we can be more responsive to problems of compliance during the first few days of use; the contribution of telemonitoring can be very positive in a context of poor compliance. In France, compulsory health insurance coverage of CPAP treatment is authorised for patients aged over 16 with clinical symptoms and an AHI \u226515 events per hour and <30 events/h in patients with severe cardiovascular co-morbidity. These patients are often not very sleepy due to sympathetic hypertonia with a shorter sleep duration. They are at high risk of non-compliance. The IPIAM study specifically targets a population at cardiovascular risk and at high risk of non-compliance with CPAP treatment. The IPIAM study aims to involve patients in the success of their treatment via remote monitoring and to show that this approach makes it possible to improve the handling of alerts and to participate in the therapeutic support of the patient. Finally, this population also shares the risk of heart rhythm disorders. As part of a cross-disciplinary inter-pathology telemonitoring approach, it also makes sense to screen for cardiac rhythm disorders by wearing a connected watch."
