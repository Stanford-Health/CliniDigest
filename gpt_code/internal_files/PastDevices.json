            "Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common arrhythmia affecting 1.3 million people in the UK. AF causes an irregular and fast heartbeat, which makes the heart pump poorly. As a result, blood clots may form inside the heart and, if they travel to the brain, can lead to an AF-related stroke. Patients with AF have a risk of stroke five-times higher than patients with normal rhythm. Anticoagulants make the blood less likely to clot and, thus, reduce the chances of an AF-related stroke. For most people, once anticoagulation is started it must be taken for the rest of their lives irrespective of the amount of AF someone has. However, anticoagulants make patients more prone to bleeding. New studies have reported a lower stroke risk in patients with short and infrequent AF episodes. If there are long time gaps in between AF episodes, short periods of anticoagulation around the time of AF may be enough to avoid clots from forming and reducing the overall risk of bleeding. To use anticoagulants only when needed will require an accurate and reliable way to detect AF when it occurs and alert patients. New technologies, such as small heart monitors placed under the skin, watches and rings, can track the heart rhythm continuously and send real-time alerts to patients via mobile phone message if AF is detected. The purpose of this study is to investigate if implantable cardiac monitors (LINQ II) and wearable devices (Apple Watch and CART-I ring) can detect AF episodes, send real-time alerts to patients and who will respond to these alerts within a short timeframe. The investigators will recruit 50 patients and follow them for six months. All participants will receive a LINQ II and a wearable device."

To date, all PTSD assessments are retrospective; individuals with PTSD are asked to recount and report their symptoms over the past weeks or months. Such assessment procedures are negatively impacted by individuals' abilities to accurately recall information. Moreover, retrospective assessments provide little information about how symptoms are experienced in the moment and how these experiences then lead to other behaviors. The proposed project addresses these limitations by assessing PTSD symptoms and associated biological markers (e.g., sleep, heart rate, heart rate variability) in real-time by asking subjects to wear a smart device and complete brief surveys. Data will be collected from 50 individuals with PTSD and 20 healthy controls to help us better understand individuals' real-time experience with PTSD and lay the foundation to develop algorithms for possible in-the-moment interventions in the future."

            "There is a fundamental gap in understanding the maternal and neonatal effects of antenatal corticosteroid (ACS) administration in women with threatened preterm birth (PTB) who have diabetes. Since the initial discovery of ACS for neonatal benefit in 1972, more than 40 randomized controlled trials have been performed evaluating its efficacy. However, none of these trials have included women with T2DM, and there is limited data among women with gestational diabetes. While ACS have been shown to reduce neonatal morbidity associated with PTB in non-diabetic women, the side effects of ACS (maternal hyperglycemia and fetal hyperinsulinemia) may mitigate the neonatal benefit of ACS in women with diabetes. Before neonatal benefit of ACS can be evaluated in this population, the first step is to optimize maternal glycemic control after ACS. Previous studies evaluating maternal hyperglycemia after ACS have been limited by small sample size, retrospective study design, or insufficient glucose data. Use of continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) in a randomized clinical trial provides a unique opportunity to overcome these challenges. Our long-term goal is to improve maternal and child health among women with diabetes as an independently funded clinical researcher. The research objectives of this proposal are to test the efficacy of three treatment strategies at achieving maternal glycemic control after ACS and evaluate the association between maternal glycemic control and neonatal outcomes. Our central hypothesis is that treatment with a continuous insulin infusion will improve maternal glycemic control, which is key to improving neonatal outcomes, but at the cost of less patient satisfaction and more health resource utilization. This hypothesis will be tested by pursuing the following specific aims: 1) Test the efficacy of three treatment strategies (addition of sliding scale insulin, up-titration of home insulin, and continuous insulin infusion) at achieving maternal glycemic control after ACS and 2) Quantify the association between maternal glycemic control after ACS and neonatal morbidity. Completion of these aims will determine the optimal strategy to achieve maternal glycemic control after ACS and inform a larger, multicenter trial to improve neonatal outcomes among women with diabetes and threatened PTB."

            "Inpatient management of glycemia in people with diabetes has been inadequately studied. Previous randomized trials of intensive insulin therapy in the hospital setting resulted in excessive hypoglycemia. Current ADA guidelines (glucose 140-180 mg/dL) are by consensus with the upper bound defined by observational data and the lower bound by safety concerns. None of the previous studies of intensive glucose management used CGM technology. Whether near normal glucose levels can be achieved without increasing hypoglycemia among hospitalized patients with diabetes with the advent of CGM technology is not known. There are clear associations between hyperglycemia and poor outcomes in patients with diabetes hospitalized with infection, including COVID-19. The COVID-19 pandemic has increased the urgency to definitively answer the question of whether glucose lowering below 140-180 mg/dL can be achieved without increasing hypoglycemia. If this proposed study demonstrates intensive management of glucose to a target of 90 to 130 mg/dL without hypoglycemia is achievable in the inpatient setting with CGM technology, a larger study could then be performed to evaluate whether there is clinical benefit including a reduction in morbidity and mortality. The primary study hypothesis is that glucose management with CGM can achieve a mean glucose of 90-130 mg/dL without increasing hypoglycemia compared with standard care with a glucose target of 140-180 mg/dL. Individuals with diabetes who are hospitalized (non-ICU) for an eligible condition will be randomly assigned to receive standard therapy (glucose target 140-180 mg/dL per ADA guidelines) or intensive therapy (glucose target 90-130 mg/dL and CGM used for monitoring). Real-time CGM will be used in the Intensive Target Group and masked CGM will be used in the Standard Target Group. The co-primary outcomes, assessed via a hierarchical approach, include a treatment group comparison of mean glucose (superiority) followed by a non-inferiority comparison of time <54 mg/dL measured with CGM."

            "Glucose control during labor is important for both fetus and mother. During labor and delivery, the goal is to maintain the sugars in the normal range as safely as possible as increased blood sugars 4-6 h prior to delivery leads to increased rates of hypoglycemia in the neonate. Neonatal hypoglycemia is a risk for the offspring of pregnant women with diabetes and occurs when fetal pancreatic hyperplasia is acutely stimulated by a high fetal glucose level derived from maternal hyperglycemia during labor. The maternal blood glucose level during delivery is a predictor of the neonatal blood glucose level. Modern continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) systems can capture the direction and magnitude of short-lived changes in interstitial glucose levels and are therefore useful for assessing glucose variability more accurately than self-monitoring blood glucose (SMBG) measurements. Indeed, it has already been demonstrated that intermittent blood glucose monitoring underestimates the number of hyperglycemic events, because blood glucose excursions can peak at different times of day. CGMs can help identify glycemic patterns in pregnancy, obtain and maintain glucose targets, and reduce hypoglycemia. Strict glycemic control during labor and delivery may reduce the risk of neonatal hypoglycemia. Two groups have reported on the use of CGM in type 1 diabetics during labor in small pilot studies. Another study looked at effects of maternal glucose levels in insulin-treated women during labor and delivery (2 to 8 h before birth) and resultant neonatal hypoglycemia. The researchers found that maternal hyperglycemia before delivery was correlated with neonatal hypoglycemia. Although more studies are needed, CGM use has promise as a therapy to improve outcomes in pregnancies associated with diabetes. In this study, the investigators plan to explore whether the use of blinded glucose monitoring during labor, delivery, and early postpartum supplementary to normally monitored plasma glucose measurements in women with gestational diabetes (GDM) would provide useful information to improve glycemia during labor in this diabetic population. All CGM data will be masked and therefore not available to participants, clinicians, or researchers at the time of delivery. Participants otherwise will receive standard clinical care. The blinded glucose monitoring data on glycemia throughout labor and post-delivery will be retrospectively assessed."

Traumatic nightmares generate disabling symptoms such as anxiety reactions, while maintaining the symptoms by depriving the individual of good quality sleep. Traumatic nightmares may thus be a sign of PTSD seriousness and chronicity, although their physiological basis remain poorly known.

The first-line KOA management is nonsurgical care, with education and exercise therapy as key elements. Nevertheless, treatment effects of exercise therapy and behavioral pain management on improvements in pain, function and quality of life are small to moderate at best. This shows that there is an urgent need for better KOA care. The innovative solution may lie in thinking beyond joints, by targeting KOA subgroups through comorbidity-specific interventions, which fits well in the global move towards precision medicine. With a prevalence rate up to 50%, the presence of insomnia symptoms is a highly prevalent KOA comorbidity, contributing to symptom severity. If left untreated, it represents a barrier for effective conservative management. Since insomnia is nowadays hardly addressed in the often joint-targeted KOA care, the scientific objectives of the study are to assess 1) if cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) integrated in best-evidence usual care, consisting of education and exercise therapy, (CBTi-UC) is more effective than best-evidence usual care alone (UC), i.e. education and exercise therapy, at 6 months follow-up in improving clinical outcomes and 2) if CBTi-UC is more cost-effective than UC in KOA patients with comorbid insomnia."

            "The benefits of physical activity and adequate sleep are well documented, and their importance strengthens with the increasing prevalence of chronic diseases and multimorbidity. Interventions to promote physical activity and sleep that use commercial activity trackers may be useful non-pharmacological approaches to managing individual health; however, limited evidence exists on their use to improve physical activity in elderly patients with multimorbidity. This study aims to measure the effects of behavioral change techniques (BCTs) delivered by a wearable device on physical activity (PA) and quality of sleep (QS) in elderly patients with multimorbidity. The investigators designed an open-label randomized controlled trial with participants recruited through primary care and a specialist outpatient clinic. Participants must be more than 65 years old, have multimorbidity, and have access to smartphones. All eligible participants will receive PA promotion content and will be randomly assigned to wear a smartwatch. The primary outcome will be the participants' PA measurement at six months using the IPAQ-SF. Secondary outcomes will include changes in the participants' frailty status, biometric measurements, quality of life, and biopsychosocial assessments. A sample size of 40 participants per arm was calculated to detect group differences, with 50 participants recruited and randomized into each arm. This study aims to contribute to a better understanding of PA patterns and the impact of smartwatch-based PA interventions in patients with multimorbidity. The trial's findings are expected to improve our understanding of how physical activity patterns, patient-reported outcomes (PROMs), and healthcare resource utilization are linked in patients with multiple medical conditions. The study will use a registry for locally developed PROMs and data from the participants' medical records to determine how wearable data and medical information data can be used to predict PROMs and unplanned hospital admissions."

Different professional societies, including the German Society of Pneumology and the European Respiratory Society, recommend rehabilitation intervention to reduce the sequelae of COVID-19. However, from the perspective of science and practice, there are relevant areas that have been insufficiently investigated and are essential for the treatment success of post/long COVID patients: - Differentiation of rehabilitation effects from natural recovery after COVID-19. - Lack of personalized and symptom-based treatment approaches that can address the heterogeneity of symptoms in post/long COVID - Lack of uniform, high-quality rehabilitation standards in post-/long-COVID. Therefore, post-COVID patients will be recruited at several post-COVID practices around Germany and randomized to receive (A) a rehabilitation program or (B) usual care. The primary objective of this randomized controlled trial (RCT) is to investigate whether a 3-week symptom-oriented, inpatient, multidisciplinary rehabilitation intervention, whose content focus is standardized according to cluster assignment (fatigue, cognition, soma), has a positive effect on the quality of life (primary outcome) in post-COVID syndrome patients compared to a usual care group (standard outpatient care). All study participants will be provided with a continuous telemonitoring system (SaniQ app) throughout the study period.

            "Background: Although the health benefits of physical activity are well established, it remains challenging for people to adopt a more active lifestyle. Mobile health (mHealth) interventions can be effective tools to promote physical activity and reduce sedentary behavior. Promising results have been obtained by using gamification techniques as behavior change strategies, especially when they were tailored toward an individual's preferences and goals; yet, it remains unclear how goals could be personalized to effectively promote health behaviors. Objective: In this study, the investigators aim to evaluate the impact of personalized goal setting in the context of gamified mHealth interventions. The investigators hypothesize that interventions suggesting health goals that are tailored based on end users' (self-reported) current and desired capabilities will be more engaging than interventions with generic goals. Methods: The study was designed as a 2-arm randomized intervention trial. Participants were recruited among staff members of Noorderkempen governmental organization. They participated in an 8-week digital health promotion campaign that was especially designed to promote walks, bike rides, and sports sessions. Using an mHealth app, participants could track their performance on two social leaderboards: a leaderboard displaying the individual scores of participants and a leaderboard displaying the average scores per organizational department. The mHealth app also provided a news feed that showed when other participants had scored points. Points could be collected by performing any of the 6 assigned tasks (eg, walk for at least 2000 m). The level of complexity of 3 of these 6 tasks was updated every 2 weeks by changing either the suggested task intensity or the suggested frequency of the task. The 2 intervention arms-with participants randomly assigned-consisted of a personalized treatment that tailored the complexity parameters based on participants' self-reported capabilities and goals and a control treatment where the complexity parameters were set generically based on national guidelines. Measures were collected from the mHealth app as well as from intake and posttest surveys and analyzed using hierarchical linear models.

            "Foods in the human diet can affect the development of diseases over time, such as diabetes or heart disease. This is because the amount and types of foods in the diet eat can affect a person's weight, and because different foods are metabolised (processed) by the body in different ways. Scientists have also found that the bacteria in the human gut (the gut microbiome) affect their metabolism, weight and health and that, together with a person's diet and metabolism, could be used to predict appetite and how meals affect the levels of sugar (glucose) and fats (lipids) found in blood after eating. If blood sugar and fat are too high too often for too long, there is a greater chance of developing diseases such as diabetes and cardiovascular disease. The gut microbiome is different in different people. Only 10-20% of the types of bacteria found in the human gut are found in everyone. This might mean that the best diet to prevent disease needs matching to a person's gut microbiome and it might be possible to find personalised foods or diets that will help reduce the chance of developing chronic disease as well as metabolic syndrome. The study investigators are recruiting volunteers aged 18-70 years to take part in a study that aims to answer the questions above. Participants will be asked to consume standardised meals on up to 8 days while wearing glucose monitors (Abbott Freestyle Libre) to measure their blood sugar levels.

            "Obesity disproportionately impacts sexual minority women. Behavioral weight loss programs are the gold standard treatment for mild to moderate obesity. The investigators have developed an online behavioral weight loss program that is effective, low-cost, and highly scalable. However, existing research suggests that tailoring treatment to address 3 well-established weight loss barriers in sexual minority women will be critical for maximizing the relevance and efficacy of behavioral weight loss for this group. In the Preparation Phase of this K23, the investigators developed 3 novel treatment components targeting sexual minority women's weight loss barriers (i.e., minority stress, low social support, and negative body image), the investigators piloted the program among sexual minority women of higher weight, and the investigators conducted individual qualitative interviews to elicit feedback on the intervention's acceptability, cultural relevance, usability, and feasibility, and this feedback was used to refine the program. In the Optimization Phase of this K23 (the current phase), 88 women will receive 12 weeks of Rx Weight Loss and will be randomized to receive 0-3 tailored components in a full factorial design with 23 (8) distinct combinations of components. Novel components that increase mean weight loss (by \u22652%) or the proportion of women achieving clinically meaningful weight loss (by \u226510%) at 6 months will be retained in a finalized obesity treatment package that the investigators will evaluate in a future randomized controlled trial (RCT) (Evaluation Phase). The aims of this study are to: Aim 2A (Optimization): Use a factorial experiment to determine how 3 novel components impact mean weight loss and the proportion of women achieving a 5+% weight loss at 6 months. Aim 2B (Mediation): Clarify how tailored components impact weight loss by testing hypothesized mechanisms of action (i.e., coping with stress, perceived social support, weight and shape concerns). This project will tailor and optimize an evidence-based online behavioral obesity treatment to enhance weight loss outcomes in sexual minority women."

            "Pregnancy and delivery are major stressors on the female body and contribute significantly to permanent weight gain and associated morbidity in women. This can profoundly affect the ability of active duty (AD) women to advance in their career. The first 12 weeks postpartum are the time period during which the most significant weight loss occurs and is critical in achieving a healthy weight in the first year postpartum. Many factors contribute to effective weight loss in this period among which the most critical are diet, exercise, and sleep. Breast feeding and depression may also affect weight changes postpartum. Research has shown diet to likely be the most crucial of these factors. The PADaWL study is designed as a randomized controlled trial to assess the effects of dietary intervention on weight and physical fitness versus routine postpartum care in the first year postpartum. Subjects will be primiparous AD women from any military service recruited in the obstetric clinic in the third trimester of pregnancy at Tripler Army Medical Center. Data will collected in an ambi-directional fashion with pre-pregnancy physical fitness data, demographic and pregnancy data collected at time of enrollment. Subjects will be randomized to receive intensive virtual sessions with a dietician vs routine postpartum care for the first 12 months postpartum. We will utilize a biometric device to monitor activity levels and sleep, web-based diaries to monitor breast feeding and diet, and validated questionnaires to evaluate depression as well as diet and sleep. Subjects will be monitored weekly for the first 12 weeks postpartum and will then be further evaluated at 6, 9 and 12 months postpartum. Primary outcome is weight at 12weeks postpartum and whether subjects have achieved military standards. Secondary outcome will be weight at 12 months postpartum and whether subject has achieved weight and fitness standards. The study intends to collect large amounts of data, and we intend to analyze which factors may be contributing to weight retention postpartum. This study should provide an accurate assessment of the effects of pregnancy on AD women. It should generate a clean and accurate dataset on which multiple follow-on studies can be performed and provide data for designing further intervention studies in postpartum women. The results of this study should also be able to assist in developing policy and guidance concerning AD women and pregnancy."

            "Mental health disorders are one of the most challenging chronic conditions to identify, treat and manage. This is largely due to the fact that diagnoses are almost entirely based on the patient's recall of current and past subjective experiences of symptoms; and then further interpreted by a healthcare professional introducing multiple layers of information biases in the formulation of a diagnosis. Accordingly, mental health conditions remain prevalent with high rates of misdiagnosis, inappropriate treatment and delayed intervention. In light of the heterogeneity across and within mental health conditions, a personalized interventional approach holds merit, yet the tools to effectively track an individual's day to day objective and subjective experience needed to achieve an individualized care approach have not until recently existed. Digital technologies such as passive and active sensing from smartphones and from wearable devices are shedding light on the capabilities of tracking new objective measures of health that could translate to key symptoms of mental health conditions. 'Multimodal data' approaches are those that attempt to translate a variety of electrical signals from digital devices to relevant health outcomes. The combination of digital devices to detect multimodal measures of mental health symptoms offers a unique opportunity to take a ground up approach in understanding the fluidity of mental health symptoms occurring at the individual level that might lend insight into new phenotypes of mental health illnesses that could have a physiological underpinning. The Study Investigators aim to characterize the multiplexing and fluid nature of mental health symptoms across individuals experiencing mental health symptoms and conditions using digital tools (i.e., wearables and mobile apps) and additional context information collected from virtual study support calls. The Investigators hope to know how objective measures from sensor data translate to core symptoms, episodes and flares across mental health disorders, and develop new (or new applications of) machine learning anomaly detection approaches and determine whether anomalies in expected symptom portraits can be reliably detected and enhanced by the addition of objectively measured data."

There has been evidence that lifestyle modifications such as physical activity (PA), dietary intake, sleep, and stress management can prevent or delay type 2 diabetes (T2D). The purpose of this study is to assess the efficacy of a holistic lifestyle digital health intervention with post-GDM women in large community settings in Singapore. The study consists of a 1-year randomized controlled trial (RCT) with 3 years follow-up. Women who are eligible for the study will be randomized to either Group 1 (Intervention) or Group 2 (Control) at baseline. Both groups will be followed in years 2-4. Women from both groups will be provided with an Oura ring for tracking physical activity, sleep, and heart rate variability (a proxy for stress), and the \"HAPPY app,\" which will provide health promotion information about physical activity, diet, sleep, and mental wellbeing, as well as display the information collected (such as body mass index, blood pressure, and OGTT results).

            "Ectopic Fat in Singaporean Women - the Culprit Leading to Gestational Diabetes, Metabolic Syndrome, and Type 2 Diabetes (TANGO Study)",
            "Ectopic fat is the accumulation of adipose tissue in anatomical sites not classically associated with fat storage - for example, in the liver and skeletal muscles. Excessive fat accumulation in liver cells, often diagnosed as non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), is a precursor to a wide range of liver conditions and metabolic disorders. The usual standard of care for NAFLD is to advise weight loss through controlled diet and physical activity, but the outcome of weight management and treatment of NAFLD is highly variable. Diet interventions - such as the Mediterranean, ketogenic, paleo, and high-protein-low-carbohydrate diets - have shown varied benefits in the management of NAFLD. However, food-based interventions must align with cultural and regional preferences in food to succeed in making the modifications part of the habitual diet. A recent diet intervention study (Della Pepa et al., 2020) highlighted that the components of a diet, rather than its caloric content, play a greater role in achieving healthier outcomes. In this study, a multifactorial diet intervention using locally sourced and produced meals will be implemented with the aim of reducing elevated liver fat content in healthy women diagnosed with NAFLD. The study will also evaluate the effects of the proposed diet on the participants' metabolic health and describe potential changes in their gut microbiome signatures (via frequent stool samples). The dysregulation of the gut microbiota has been linked to the development of NAFLD and it is known that the composition of the gut microbiota could be modified by dietary intake. This study will investigate the association of gut microbiome signatures with elevated liver fat in Asian women and test whether the dietary intervention will modify their gut microbiota. Finally, ectopic fat in the liver is a highly prevalent condition worldwide but the cut-off values for NAFLD has been largely derived from studies performed in Western populations. This study seeks to cross examine the diagnostic ranges in various clinical assessments of NAFLD that commonly involve ultrasound spectroscopy (Fibroscan), fatty liver indexes (FLI) and magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS). This effort seeks to derive appropriate cut-off values for NAFLD in Singaporean-Chinese women."

            "90% of Asian workers report high levels of stress in an \"always-on\" culture. Stress and burnout are risk factors that account for 10-20% of health expenditure and threaten work longevity in the world's fastest growing economies. Traditional face-to-face sources of mental care such as counseling and psychotherapy are effective as a countermeasure to stress, but not always accessible or acceptable for those with busy lifestyles. Because of this, there is an urgent need for on-demand, scalable interventions to reduce stress and improve mental and physical well being. Technology-based solutions are increasingly being proposed to fill this need. MindFi is a smartphone app that uses mindfulness exercises to help users cope with work stress and increase productivity. Since 2017, it has been featured by Apple, BBC, and Bloomberg and is being used at corporates such as Bain, Bloomberg, Cigna, and Zendesk. MindFi users contribute behavioral and self-report data, which are then used to generate individual recommendations for relevant, evidence-based exercises. These include mental care techniques such as mindfulness meditation, therapeutic journaling, psychosocial support and educational wellbeing quizzes. In this study, the investigators will recruit 200 participants in a randomized controlled design, with 100 receiving access to content of the MindFi app, and 100 receiving access to a version containing music tracks for relaxation. Each intervention will last 4 weeks. Participants will use these apps for a period of 5 weeks (for a minimum of 10 minutes per day). Pre- and post-intervention, the investigators will measure self-reported ratings on a number of psychological variables, and will track sleep quality objectively for a one-week period."

The objectives of the projects are as follows: - To experimentally assess the role of a dopamine, and a noradrenalin reuptake inhibitor in the onset of exercise-induced fatigue - To identify changes in brain activation associated with altered PF and fatigue perception - To experimentally assess the effect of a NA or DA reuptake inhibitor on MF, brain activation and the sources of changes in brain activation - To experimentally assess the role of brain neurotransmitters (DA, NA) in the interaction between mental and PF from a neurophysiological perspective. Participants will be healthy young adults. In each study, they will start with a familiarization trial followed by two experimental trials and one control trial with a randomized treatment order. At each visit, different drugs will be administered to elicit different neurotransmitter response. The trials will be performed at the MFYS exercise lab (BLITS, VUB campus Etterbeek, Boulevard General Jaques 271, 1050 Elsene (Brussels)).

While participants will perform above mentioned task their EEG signal and heart rate will be measured. At the same time, participants will report on their subjective feeling of fatigue during these tasks. In addition, all participants will be administered cognitive tasks before and after the study, along with questionnaires. In the second and third experiments, tensiomyography and electromyography will also be recorded from the quadriceps muscle of the leg used for knee extension.

            "Temporomandibular joint dysfunction (TMD) is a broad clinical picture involving the TMJ and its disc, masticatory musculature, ligament tissue, and autonomic nervous system (ANS). TMD symptoms include decrease or excessive increase in joint range of motion (ROM), clicking sound or crepitation in the joint, pain around the joint or muscle group, chewing and swallowing problems. Pain caused by MPS, trigger point, fatigue, limitation of ROM, and ANS dysfunction cause TMD. With the inclusion of habits such as clenching and bruxism, pain, spasm and disability develop in the chewing muscles. Exposure to repeated trauma and excessive use of chewing muscles may cause the formation of tight bands and trigger points, which are characterized by MPS. When the relationship between TMD and ANS was examined, it was observed that increased sympathetic activity and decreased parasympathetic activity were effective in the severity of TMD symptoms. Auricular vagus nerve stimulation is a peripheral, non-pharmacological and non-invasive neuromodulation technique that modifies signal processing in the CNS, activates reflex circuits, exploits brain plasticity for different therapeutic purposes, thereby affecting very different areas of the brain. Non-invasive or transcutaneous Vagus Nerve Stimulation delivery systems provide stimulation in the auricular branch of the vagus nerve in the outer ear, thus eliminating the need for surgical implantation. The aim of our study is to reveal the extent to which Auricular Vagus Nerve Stimulation, applied in addition to the conventional rehabilitation program, affects the results of the treatment by stimulating the parasympathetic nervous system in patients with Temporomandibular Joint Dysfunction caused by Myofascial Pain Syndrome."

            "Exercising in a nature setting has been credited with benefits for health and well-being, more so than exercising indoors. Additionally, motoric performance in the same exercise (e.g., running speed, more strenuous physical activity) has been reported in some studies to be greater if practiced outdoors, in a nature setting. The explanation may be in the inherent variability of natural landscapes, the textures, elevations, obstacles and objects which are not found in standard built and indoor settings. Indoor settings are characterized by safe, organized, patterned textures and objects created for specific ends, which inhibit variability in physical and physiological behavior. Variability in the environment turns into variability in body systems, which benefits health, well-being, and skill acquisition. Variability in behavior depends also on the task. Running or walking is essentially a journey throughout the environment in which interaction with obstacles, puddles, and other runners is part of the variability of the activity. On the other hand, physical activity such as HICT is done in a small area, and is a scripted, prescribed activity (e.g., push-ups, sit-ups), which lowers the amount of variability in behavior. The aim of this trial is to test if a low variability activity shows differences in performance, wellbeing, and behavior measures according to the amount of variability in the environment. In this trial the participants will engage in two high intensity circuit training (HICT) interventions - one in an indoor setting, and another in a nature setting. The HICT intervention includes 12 calisthenic exercises, and will be performed at a self-selected intensity by the participants. Each exercise will be performed during one minute, followed by 30 seconds of rest where the participants will be instructed what the next exercise will be. Before exercising, the participants put a heart rate monitor and two inertial measurement units (IMUs) on the right arm and leg, according to the correct usage guidelines, and rate their positive affect, arousal, and perceived exertion. Immediately after exercising, they rate the same measures again. Research Hypotheses: Greater movement variability, heart rate variability, performance, wellbeing, and arousal during HICT in nature setting than indoor setting."

            "Alzheimer's Disease (AD) and Alzheimer's Disease-Related Dementias (ADRD) not only exact a heavy toll on patients, they also impose an enormous emotional, physical, and financial burden on unpaid, often family, caregivers. The strain of providing care for a loved one diagnosed with AD, often across several years, is associated with elevated depression risk and poorer overall health. Emotion regulation skills represent an ideal target for psychological intervention to promote healthy coping in ADRD caregivers. The project seeks to use an experimental medicine approach to test the efficacy and biobehavioral mechanisms of a novel, relatively brief, targeted, scalable, smartphone-based cognitive emotion regulation intervention aimed at improving psychological outcomes (i.e., reducing perceived stress, caregiver burden, and depressive symptoms) in ADRD unpaid primary caregivers as well as examine potential benefits of the caregiver intervention on quality of life in care recipients. Cognitive reappraisal is the ability to modify the trajectory of an emotional response by thinking about and appraising emotional information in an alternative, more adaptive way. Reappraisal can be operationalized via two primary tactics: psychological distancing (i.e. appraising an emotional stimulus as an objective, impartial observer) and reinterpretation (i.e., imagining a better outcome than what initially seemed apparent). The project will investigate the efficacy and underlying biobehavioral mechanisms of a novel, one-week cognitive reappraisal intervention in this population, with follow-up assessments at 2 weeks, 4 weeks, and 3 months. ADRD unpaid primary caregivers will be randomly assigned to receive training in either distancing, reinterpretation, or a no regulation natural history control condition, with ecological momentary assessments of self-reported positive and negative affect, remotely- collected psychophysiological health-related biomarkers (i.e., heart rate variability data) using pre-mailed Polar H10 chest bands, and health-related questionnaire reports.

            "Post-Covid syndrome is defined as symptoms that develop in addition to respiratory symptoms in individuals who have had Covid-19 infection for more than 12 weeks. Symptoms such as fatigue, headache, cognitive impairment, dyspnea, heart palpitations, heat intolerance, digestive system disorders, sleep disorders, dermal problems, orthostatic intolerance come to the fore in individuals with post-Covid syndrome. It has been tried to be revealed in some studies that Covid-19 infection affects the autonomic nervous system (ANS) and the relationship between Post-Covid 19 syndrome and ANS dysfunction. Heart rate variability (HRV) measurement method can be used to evaluate ANS activity. HRV is a non-invasive method and is a measure of the change in heart rate over a period of time. HRV is a scalar quantity that shows the time between two beats of the heart and defines the oscillations between the R-R intervals. In HRV measurements, time-dependent and frequency-dependent measurement results are obtained and from these measurements, time-dependent RMSSD (square root of the square of the difference of the R-R intervals) and frequency-dependent high-frequency (HF) and low frequency (LF) measurement components are used in relation to the sympathetic nervous system (CNS) and parasympathetic nervous system (PSS). HRV can be measured in short-term (5 minutes) in terms of measurement time. The aim of this study is to clearly reveal the relationship between Post-Covid 19 syndrome and ANS dysfunction and to provide standardization related to HRV measurement method and sub-parameters."

Common symptoms include fatigue, shortness of breath, and cognitive dysfunction, among others, and result in an impact on daily functioning. Symptoms may be new onset, appear after initial recovery from an acute episode of COVID-19, or persist after the initial illness. Cardiac variability (HRV) was initially used in COVID-19 to predict mortality in the acute setting. Dysautonomia which partly evaluates HRV is frequent in patients with persistent COVID. Several groups have used voice or other respiratory noise analysis for the diagnosis of acute COVID. Patients in the persistent COVID cohort will be able to be differentiated from an age, sex and vaccination status matched cohort of recovered COVID patients without sequelae by means of a model created by Machine Learning that will be trained using cardiac variability (HRV), skin conductance and acoustic analysis data.

            "While the association of physical and/or motor and/or cognitive components with training can generate synergistic effects and thus create an efficient cognitive enrichment program, very few studies have focused on finding an optimal combined program for older adults. According to the model of Herold and his colleagues, there are two modalities of simultaneous combined training: Thinking While Moving (TwM), when the additional cognitive task is not linked to the motor task, and Moving While Thinking (MwT), when the cognitive task is integrated into the motor task. They assume the latter approach is the most promising for improving cognitive reserve. Nevertheless, to the investigators' knowledge, only one study has compared these two modalities in older adults and none has broadened the question by comparing several MwT trainings. The goal of this interventional study will be to compare the cognitive, dual-task, and physical effects of 6 physical and/or cognitive programs in healthy but inactive older adults. The main questions it will aims to answer are: - Will the Moving While Thinking and Thinking While Moving programs have the same effects? - If they have different effects, which will be the best way to improve cognitive, dual-task, and physical functions? The study is being set up between 2023 and 2025 to compare the cognitive, dual- ask and physical effects of 6 programs (3 months, 2 sessions of 1 hour per week). Three experimental MwT programs will be studied: Immersive and interactive wall exergames (I2WE), Complex Cognitive and Motor Activities (2CMA), and exergames with Switch (EXER). They will be compared to an experimental TwM program of stationary bike simultaneous to the Switch (Video games + bike) and 2 control programs: inactive video games (VG) and stationary bike (BIKE). A control group (CON) will be also created. Cognitive, dual-task, and physical pre-tests (before the program), post-tests (after the program), and retention tests (3 months after the end of the program) will be realized to evaluate the effects of the programs."

            "Community service providers (CSPs), such as promotores and other community health staff, play an essential role in preserving health and treating disease in underserved Hispanic/Latinx (HL) communities with disproportionately high rates of cardiometabolic (CM) disease. Although effective programs have been developed that deploy CSPs to reduce CM disease risk in the community, to our knowledge no interventions have sought to reduce CM risk among CSPs themselves. However, CSPs are also at high risk for adverse CM outcomes, as they have the same high-risk demographics as the communities they serve and they work in high-stress, frontline jobs. Reducing CM risk among HL CSPs is crucial to promote health at both the individual and community levels; that is, preventive interventions delivered to CSPs may not only promote the health of the individual CSPs who receive the intervention but also may bolster CSPs to more effectively deliver programming that protects CM health community-wide. The proposed study employs relational savoring (RS), a brief intervention rooted in positive psychology and attachment, which has previously been shown to promote psychosocial well-being and which is particularly efficacious in HL populations. Emerging research supports that RS may also promote more optimal cardiovascular regulation and health behavior. Therefore, the investigators deliver RS to CSPs in order to identify CM health protective effects for both CSPs and the high-risk communities they serve. Aims and Hypotheses: Aim 1: Examine effects of RS on CSPs' CM risk factors and outcomes. Hypotheses: RS (compared to wait-list control) will be associated with lower CM risk, as indexed by higher mean HRV, both during a stressor and at rest (H1A). RS will also be associated with a more favorable CM health behavior profile, indexed by higher quality sleep, more exercise, and healthier diet (H1B). Aim 2: Examine effects of RS on CSPs' delivery of CM health programming to the community. Hypotheses: RS will be associated both with reduced threats to CSPs leaving the workforce, including higher satisfaction with work, greater agency, and lower burnout (H2A), and with a higher number of community members reached for CM health programming, as indexed by number of days CSP worked, number of health-related events offered by CSPs, community attendance at events, and retention of community members across multi-day programs (H2B)."

Mobile health (mHealth) interventions can be effective tools to promote physical activity and reduce sedentary behavior. Promising results have been obtained by using gamification techniques as behavior change strategies, especially when they were tailored toward an individual's preferences and goals; yet, it remains unclear how goals could be personalized to effectively promote health behaviors. Objective: In this study, the investigators aim to evaluate the impact of personalized goal setting in the context of gamified mHealth interventions. The investigators hypothesize that interventions suggesting health goals that are tailored based on end users' (self-reported) current and desired capabilities will be more engaging than interventions with generic goals. Methods: The study was designed as a 2-arm randomized intervention trial. Participants were recruited among staff members of Noorderkempen governmental organization. They participated in an 8-week digital health promotion campaign that was especially designed to promote walks, bike rides, and sports sessions. Using an mHealth app, participants could track their performance on two social leaderboards: a leaderboard displaying the individual scores of participants and a leaderboard displaying the average scores per organizational department. The mHealth app also provided a news feed that showed when other participants had scored points. Points could be collected by performing any of the 6 assigned tasks (eg, walk for at least 2000 m). The level of complexity of 3 of these 6 tasks was updated every 2 weeks by changing either the suggested task intensity or the suggested frequency of the task. The 2 intervention arms-with participants randomly assigned-consisted of a personalized treatment that tailored the complexity parameters based on participants' self-reported capabilities and goals and a control treatment where the complexity parameters were set generically based on national guidelines. Measures were collected from the mHealth app as well as from intake and posttest surveys and analyzed using hierarchical linear models. Note: Eindhoven University of Technology is not an official GCP sponsor. Hence, this study is not a medical clinical trial."

            "Facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (FSHD) is a devastating progressive muscle dystrophy. There is no treatment. FSHD is generally characterized by asymmetrical weakness and wasting of facial, shoulder girdle and upper arm muscles followed by weakness of muscles of the trunk and lower extremities, but disease severity varies widely between patients. Relatively long periods of stability are interspersed with short periods of potentially steep decline, leading overall to a slow but unpredictable rate of progression. Different genotypes underlying FSHD have been identified, but they result in highly similar phenotypes and at the molecular level converge on undue expression of the transcription factor, DUX4, in skeletal muscle, which is thought to (ultimately) lead to muscle wasting due to inflammation, apoptosis, and oxidative stress. There is no approved treatment, although various companies are engaged in FSHD drug discovery and development aimed in particular at reducing DUX4 expression. Multiple treatment options are currently under development in both preclinical and early clinical stages. However, these efforts face significant challenges in the path to regulatory approval. Because of the slow and variable rate of progression of FSHD, evidencing a significant treatment response will be cumbersome using only the existing measurements of muscle function. The successful development of these investigative treatments for FSHD is therefore highly dependent on the availability of validated disease and treatment biomarkers to monitor disease progression and response to treatment, respectively. To date, no such validated biomarkers exist. This study is important for four reasons: 1. Clinical testing of FSHD drug candidates requires the availability of clinical biomarkers that (a) change relatively rapidly over time; (b) allow for identification of fast progressors; and (c) correlate with \"gold standard\", but slowly changing, clinical severity and/or functional scores. This study is a first step in that direction as it seeks to explore if the investigational digital technologies described below are able to generate single or composite variables that (cross-sectionally) distinguish FSHD patients from controls. If identified, such variables will be tested as putative clinical FSHD biomarkers in a follow-up longitudinal study with FSHD patients. 2. Patient testimonies indicate that living with FSHD means living with pain, fatigue, social isolation, and anxiety about the future. This study provides the first-ever opportunity to gather objective, real-world data about the impact of FSHD on daily life. 3. Regulators have already indicated that Real-World Data (RWD) is a top strategic priority for their drug reviews. This study aims to fill this gap by gathering RWD about the physical and social activities of FSHD patients in comparison with controls. This way we aim to find (composite) scores that correlate with selected severity and functional scores and additionally distinguish FSHD patients from controls. 4. This study offers an opportunity to expand the spectrum of diseases in which RWD may be used as (a basis for) clinical outcome measures.

            "Covid-19, a commonly severe respiratory tract infection caused by the SARS-CoV2 Coronavirus, poses an increasing threat to individual health and health care systems. The individual disease course ranges from mild to life threatening, the pandemic spread leads to a shortage of health care resources including intensive care availability. It should be the overarching goal to allocate sparse health care resources to those most at need and to simultaneously avoid unnecessary blocking of resources by clinically unjustified hospitalizations. Individuals with preexisting cardiovascular conditions are at the highest risk of health deterioration, even at younger age. Objective criteria for hospitalization are not immediately available in a outpatient settings. Hence, hospitalization and emergency medical contact is often triggered by subjectively interpreted symptoms. The goal of this project is thus to improve the availability of objective measurements in the outpatient setting by means of an innovative, smartwatch mediated telemedicine approach. To achieve this goal, the investigators will conduct a randomized clinical trial comparing a smartwatch based telemedicine intervention with standard of care. The intervention group will receive regular objective measurements of heart rate, ECG, and SpO2 and will get access to a 24/7 medical care hotline for consultation. The investigators hypothesize that the intervention group will benefit by a significant reduction in unnecessary hospitalizations and unplanned emergency medicine contacts."

The aims of the study are to determine - to determine if continuous vital signs monitoring is feasible during cancer treatment - to determine if such monitoring is acceptable to patients undergoing cancer treatment - to determine what insights could be made with the data obtained A multi-cohort study is essential because there are a huge range of vital signs monitors that could be useful and a method that allows quickly identification of the devices that are most acceptable to patients and which offer the most useful information to clinicians is needed. Similarly, the best device may vary according to the specific disease and the treatment a patient is offered. Each cohort in the study will investigate a variety of wearable vital signs monitors in different patient groups undergoing different treatments. A common data collection platform will be used for all cohorts with a modular design that allows data collection to be adapted slightly to meet specific needs for each cohort."
