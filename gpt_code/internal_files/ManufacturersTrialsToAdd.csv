https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04412720,Aerobic and Respiratory Exercises on Asthma,"Many studies have reported the benefits of aerobic and breathing exercises such as, reduction of symptoms and reduced the use of medications, the number of crises, exercise induced bronchoconstriction (EIB), and improvement in health-related quality of life (HRQoL). This study will be a randomized and controlled trial (RCT) with 2 parallel arms and blinded assessment. Fifty-four moderate or severe patients with asthma under optimized medication will be randomly assigned (computer-generated) into either aerobic+breathing exercises (AB) or aerobic+stretching exercises (AS). All patients will receive the same educational session and will perform the physical exercise proposed for the group for 12 weeks, 2 times/week, 60-minute sessions; however, the AB group will perform Buteyko breathing technique and AS will perform muscle stretching exercise. All patients will be assessed to clinical control, quality of life, psychosocial symptoms, pulmonary function, functional capacity, physical activity levels, sleep quality, thoracoabdominal mechanics, hyperventilation symptoms, and asthma exacerbation. The data normality will be analyzed by Kolmogorov-Smirnov. The variables obtained before interventions will be compared using the t-test or Mann-Whitney U-test. Comparisons of the outcomes initial and final data will be analyzed with repeated measures ANOVA with appropriate post hoc test. The significance level will be set to 5% for all tests."
https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT05762783,The Importance of Sleep for Diabetes Associated Tasks and Outcomes,"Adolescents with type 1 diabetes (T1D) experience more disturbed sleep compared to their healthy peers, especially because they tend to spend less time in deep sleep, the most restoring part of sleep, potentially impacting diabetes management. Disturbed sleep may adversely affect diabetes management which requires day-to-day decision-making, emotional and behavioural regulation, attention, and planning. Despite a massive increase in new technology, more than 50% of adolescents do not reach their glycaemic target. Lack of sleep impairing diabetes management including blood glucose monitoring may play an important role in reaching the goal. For approximately 4000 children and adolescents in Denmark living with T1D, sleep problems may therefore account for short and long-term diabetes complications. Our overall aims are to investigate: (1) If and how glycaemic variability influences sleep quality and sleep stages and (2) if and how poor sleep quality influences time-in-range (TIR), time-above-range (TAR) and time-below-range (TBR) the following day."
https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT05505578,A Digital Intervention to Improve Physical Activity and Sleep Behaviors in Youth With Psychiatric Diagnoses,"The goal of ""GamerFit"" is to test the delivery of a theory-based mHealth app that utilizes social support, exergaming, and telehealth coaching to improve PA levels, sleep, and psychiatric symptoms among youth participants (ages 13-17 y) with PD. In order to aid future intervention optimization, up to 65 participants with at least one PD will be randomized, with 30-35 using the GamerFit app with weekly telehealth coaching sessions and 30-35 using a commercial healthy habits app as a comparator group"
