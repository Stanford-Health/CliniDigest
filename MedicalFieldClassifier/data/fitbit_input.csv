The purpose of the study is to evaluate the combination of these strategies that maximizes 6-month weight loss in the context of a standalone digital health intervention for adults with overweight or obesity. The investigators will recruit 176 total participants to the trial. Recruitment will occur through remote channels. Interested individuals will be directed to an online screening questionnaire; those who are eligible will then be invited to attend an initial remote session with study personnel to ensure interest and eligibility in the study. The weight loss intervention will last 6 months, and all participants will receive a \""core\"" treatment consisting of goal setting, behavioral lessons, action plans, and tailored feedback - all of which will be delivered remotely. Depending on which group participants are assigned to in the study, some individuals will be asked to track their dietary intake, their steps, and/or their body weight via digital tools. All study tasks will occur remotely, thus, participants never need to come in-person for any intervention or assessment tasks. The investigators will use the Multiphase Optimization Strategy (MOST) framework to identify the most effective combination of self-monitoring strategies. The factorial design will allow the research team to determine the unique and combined impact of each self-monitoring component on weight change.

Recently, several studies suggested that cognitive training can improve gait in patients with PD (Peterson et al. 2016, Heremans et al. 2013), similar to the effects seen in the elderly (Yogev-Seligmann et al. 2008; Amboni et al. 2013).

Evidence supports that a large proportion of this cost and poor clinical outcomes in GERD are related to poor healthcare decisions by both the physician and the patient. The problem of inappropriate GERD management stems from three main issues. First, the disease is heterogeneous and requires treatment informed by a precision model. Second, the current paradigm largely ignores the important brain-gut interactions that drive symptoms and healthcare utilization. Third, there is a paucity of well-performed comparative effectiveness trials focused on assessing treatments beyond acid suppression. We will use physiomarkers defined during the previous funding cycle to phenotype the patients and use cognitive behavioral interventions to modulate hypervigilance to test the Psycho-Physiologic Model of GERD. Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) is able to improve hypervigilance and symptom specific autonomic arousal and thus, we will test our theory that CBT can improve outcomes in GERD by targeting these two important psychologic stressors. We will also continue our focus on the interplay of psychology and physiology by determining whether increased mucosal permeability is associated with reflux perception and whether this is modified by hypervigilance and autonomic disruption.

This evidence is clear in adults, however also in adolescents the health effects can become apparent (e.g. development of overweight, reduced fitness,...). Therefore it is important to develop interventions aiming to reduce sedentary behavior in adolescents. Adolescents are sedentary for more than 60% of the day, of wich a large part is spent at school as during school hours pupils usually have to sit at their desk. Therefore secondary schools serve as an ideal setting to target sitting behavior. Structural environmental changes (in the classroom), e.g. introducing standing desks, can be used as a possible strategy. It is important to objectively evaluate the effect of the intervention on sedentary behavior. Next to evaluating the effect on behavior, studies also recommend to evaluate the effect on cognitive performance, as this is the particular interest of schools and their staff. The primary aim of this project is therefore to investigate the effect of implementing standing desks on adolescents' cognitive function, more specifically on memory, reasoning, verbal ability and concentration. In addition, the investigators will evaluate the effect of implementing standing desks on adolescents' sitting and standing time, measured by Axivity accelerometers in the entire sample.

Sedentary lifestyle, which is reported by 90% of older Americans, is an important risk factor for both cognitive decline and sleep disturbances. Although promoting physical activity has benefits to older adults' health, including sleep and cognition, traditional interventions to increase activity are challenging due to extensive staffing requirements and low adherence. Electronic activity monitors, such as wrist-worn accelerometers, can track heart rate, activity, and sleep to allow individuals to work towards personal activity and sleep goals.

Melanoma, approximately 87,000 of the annual skin cancer cases and one of the more deadly skin cancers, is on the rise. Previous research on these individuals suggests that while some change how much time they spend in the sun and adopt ways to protect themselves when in the sun, many do not. In our previous study, we found that 20% of melanoma survivors reported a sunburn in the past year and 10% intentionally went outside for a tan, both strong indicators of inappropriate sun exposure. Melanoma survivors are at high risk of second melanomas, making it critical that they spend less time in the sun or take actions to protect themselves when they are in the sun. No studies to date have investigated technology-based strategies in melanoma survivors to improve sun exposure and protection behaviors. This project will test whether a wearable device that tracks sun exposure and provides alerts regarding sun exposure and protection behaviors will increase sun protection behaviors in melanoma survivors.

We will test the technology device versus a similar control device in 368 melanoma survivors and compare sun protection behaviors between the two groups. This project has the potential to identify a strategy that could significantly lower the number of melanoma survivors who go on to have a second melanoma diagnosis.

Recovery from colorectal surgery is difficult because of the many potential negative side effects. These side effects include surgical complications, infections, and long hospital stays. It usually takes several months for patients to recover the strength required to return to their typical daily activities. The Enhanced Recovery After Surgery program was established in Alberta in 2013 and uses several strategies to improve short-term patient recovery, including earlier discharge from hospital. Whether the ERAS program also improves long-term patient recovery, including quality of life and return to activities of daily living, is unclear. Whether the ERAS program would benefit from the addition of a prehabilitation element is unclear. Prehabilitation programs are designed to use the waiting period before colorectal surgery to better prepare patients emotionally and physically for their operation. To date, successful prehabilitation programs have used a personalized care strategy where each patient is provided specific care instructions by healthcare professionals to meet their unique exercise, nutrition, and psychological needs. This prehabilitation strategy has been criticized for not being sustainable in our healthcare system. A new prehabilitation program in response to this criticism is proposed. The prehabilitation program will be conducted in a more sustainable way by offering the program as a group class with a home-based component. ERAS patients at the Peter Lougheed Center are already offered a group class as part of the standard ERAS program. The prehabilitation class will be an extension of this group class that provides general nutrition, exercise, and anxiety-reduction/relaxation strategies to help patients prepare physically and emotionally for their operation. At this class, patients will learn to eat well, practice deep breathing exercises for relaxation, perform simple functional exercises, and to walk for exercise before their surgery. The surgical experience and outcomes of patients who received the additional prehabilitation care will be compared to those who received ERAS care only.

Interdisciplinary Pain Rehabilitation Programs (IPRPs), a subset of Interdisciplinary Treatment (IDT) includes physical activity and exercise and is considered superior to single-treatment measures in patients with chronic pain. However, effects emerge sub-optimal and as many as 30% of patients deteriorate in some outcomes. A novel intervention, eVISualisation (eVIS) of physical activity and pain, has been systematically developed to facilitate patients in reaching and maintaining recommended individualized physical activity levels. The aim is to transparently report on methodology, outcome assessments, and processes for a registry-based randomized controlled trial (R-RCT) initiated as an internal pilot study. Methods and analysis: The R-RCT will recruit approximately 400 patients with chronic pain who are registered at primary and specialized IPRP units (n=15) in Sweden. Participants will be randomly allocated to either an IPRP + eVIS or the control group that will receive only IPRP treatment. eVIS entails objectively measured physical activity (steps) and patient-reported outcomes (pain intensity, affect on daily activities, pharmaceutical consumption) collected and visualized in the web application PATRON. Data from an initial 30 participants completing the study period (6 months) will be included in a pilot study designed to evaluate recruitment- and randomization processes, standardized effect size, sample size, characteristics of outcomes, follow-up rates of the R-RCT. Outcome variables will be extracted from PATRON and from six national registries. Multivariate statistics and repeated measures analyses will be performed. Quality Adjusted Life Years (QALYs) and Incremental Cost Effectiveness Ratio (ICER) will be calculated for cost effectiveness evaluation.

The objective is to investigate the outcomes and mechanisms of an integrated depression and obesity intervention that combines collaborative stepped depression treatment and evidence-based behavioral weight loss treatment. The Integrated Coaching for Better Mood and Weight-2 (I-CARE2) intervention synergistically integrates 2 proven national programs: the Program to Encourage Active and Rewarding Lives (PEARLS) for depression care and the Group Lifestyle Balance (GLB) program for weight loss and cardiometabolic risk reduction.

Cardiac rehabilitation (CR) is the main treatment for heart attacks and other types of CVD. It is based on science, it saves money, and it is widely-available. Each session (of which there are a few each week for 3 months) combines supervised exercise and instruction. The goals are to improve overall health and reduce cardiovascular risk in individuals with established CVD. CR produces almost no weight loss (WL); if a person has excess weight while in CR (the majority of participants have overweight or obesity), losing weight could really reduce their risk of having another heart attack. The best treatment available for weight loss, in-person behavioral weight loss interventions (BWLs), produce enough WL that they improve health and disease risk/severity. However, in-person BWLs are too much work to be carried out in CR. A previous fully automated 3-month online program, Rx Weight Loss (RxWL), produced good WL in many different settings. Dr. Goldstein aims to tailor RxWL for use in CR. The study will use the Multiphase Optimization Strategy (MOST) to test innovative eHealth/mHealth intervention components that might work well for people when combined with RxWL.

Unfortunately, only 5% of US adults meet guideline of 150 minutes of moderate exercise; Veterans and non-Veterans have similar levels of PA. A patient incentive program for PA may help. Behavioral economics suggests that the chronic inability to start and maintain a PA routine may be the result of \""present bias,\"" which is a tendency to value immediate rewards over rewards in the future. With present bias, it is always better to exercise tomorrow because the immediate gratification of watching television or surfing the internet is a more powerful motivator than the intangible and delayed benefit of future health. Patient incentives may overcome present bias by moving the rewards for exercise forward in time. Recent randomized trials suggest that incentives for PA can be effective, but substantial gaps in knowledge prevent the implementation of a PA incentive program in Veterans Affairs (VA). First, incentive designs vary considerably. They vary by the size of the incentive, the type of incentive (cash or non-financial), the probability of earning an incentive (an assured payment for effort or a lottery-based incentive), or whether the incentive is earned after the effort is given (a gain-framed incentive) or awarded up-front and lost if the effort is not given (a loss-framed incentive). The optimal combination of these components for a Veteran population is unknown. Second, the evidence about the effective components of incentives comes from studies conducted in populations that were overwhelmingly female; often employees at large companies, with high levels of education and income. VA users, in contrast, are mostly male and lower income, and most are not employed. This is important because the investigators have theoretical reasons to believe that the effects of components of incentives are likely to vary by income and gender. Finally, few studies have managed to design an incentive such that the physical activity was maintained after the incentive was removed. Indeed, a common theme in incentivizing health behavior change is the difficulty in sustaining behavior change once the incentives are removed. "",",General Physiology,Chronic pain / diseases,

Levels of physical inactivity and sedentary behaviour have been poorly investigated among the CF population in Ireland. The measurement of these behaviours is important in order to monitor prevalence amongst people with CF (PWCF) and determine methods by which health care providers can assist with maintaining and enhancing physical activity. The use of physical activity monitoring can provide health care providers with insightful real world analysis of physical activity and exercise behaviours. Over the last decade there has been many advancements in technology and fitness tracking with positive results being demonstrated in the healthy population and in chronic diseases such as Diabetes Mellitus II, post surgery and Multiple Sclerosis. Limited research has been conducted among PWCF to date. The aim of this research project is to examine physical activity levels amongst PWCF and determine the effect of a 12 week randomised parallel intervention on a number of health outcomes. Participants will be provided with an accelerometer to assess physical activity and sedentary behaviour at baseline. The participants will then undergo further baseline testing to determine exercise capacity, body composition, quality of life, breathlessness, sleep quality and wellbeing. Baseline short and long term goals will be established together with the participant and physiotherapist. Participants will then be randomly allocated to either the intervention or the comparator. A researcher independent of the recruitment process (MC) will complete the first random allocation using a sealed opaque envelope. Following this a minimisation randomisation procedure will be completed based on lung function, where FEV1 of <70% predicted lung function will be classified as having mild lung disease. While those with an FEV1 of 30-50% predicted lung function will be classified as having moderate lung disease, with <30% indicating severe lung disease. Allocation will be revealed after recruitment and baseline assessments have occurred. Both groups will receive a fitness tracker which will be linked to an online monitoring system (Fitabase) for 24 weeks. The intervention group will receive personalised feedback via a text message every week on their physical activity levels as measured by their fitness tracker and progress on attainment of their goals established at the start of the study. Feedback will be provided from their CF physiotherapists. The comparator group will not receive any feedback on their Fitbit data. After 12 weeks both groups will be re-assessed. Thereafter, both groups will continue with the Fitbits alone for 12 weeks. Finally outcome measures including lung function, physical activity levels, aerobic capacity, quality of life, sleep quality, muscle mass and well-being will be re-assessed again at 24 weeks. Following the intervention semi structured interviews will be conducted to qualitatively establish satisfaction with the interventions and provide insight into barriers and enablers to achieving goals and physical activity levels.The results of this study may provide valuable insights into potential interventions to optimise the health and well-being of PWCF.

Sedentary workers are at greater risk of developing chronic diseases due to these behavioral risk factors. The literature moderately supports mHealth interventions for promoting physical activity and healthy diets. However, there is a dearth of research on mHealth interventions targeting the clustering of physical activity, sedentary and dietary behavior among sedentary workers in the occupational setting. Furthermore, there is a lack of evidence on its long-term sustainability and cost-effectiveness on health behaviors as well as health-related and work- related outcomes. Purpose: To evaluate a 12-week theory-driven, tailored mHealth intervention for improving diet, physical activity and sedentary behavior among sedentary workers. Three specific aims are to: (1) determine intervention participants' perceptions of and engagement with the mHealth program components to understand intervention effects by surveys and focus groups; (2) determine the effectiveness of the mHealth intervention compared to usual care; and (3) determine the cost-effectiveness of the mHealth intervention compared to usual care, using incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs). Methods: This is a three-year research project. Year 1 is mHealth intervention delivery and evaluation using a quasi-experimental design. Concepts of social cognitive theory of self-regulation and self-efficacy and an ecological model provide the theoretical foundation for the intervention. Year 2 will be primarily to evaluate the intervention. Year 3 will be primarily an international comparison of cost-effectiveness of mHealth interventions to improve diet, physical activity and sedentary behavior for employees.

The intervention group will also receive instructions to download and use the CarpeDiem application. Through the CarpeDiem application, participants will be able to answer follow-up questionnaires, perform missions related to the healthy consumption of various food groups, monitor their physical activity and sleep, and receive periodic, personalized and holistic recommendations based on the three pillars of health. The control group will receive instructions to download the Fitbit application and will additionally receive general recommendations for healthy lifestyle habits through standardized documents. Both groups will be provided access to the initial and final questionnaires that will be done online. All participants must return the signed informed consent either with a digital signature or by mail to the Eurecat-Barcelona headquarters. The main variable of the study is: the Mediterranean lifestyle index, calculated from the short MEDLIFE questionnaire with 28 items, validated for the Spanish adult population. The secondary variables are: Diet related: Food intake and food groups taken from the Food Frequency Questionnaire (CFCA). Diet diversity index calculated from the CFCA. Related to physical activity: Total physical activity in MET-minutes / week, extracted from the IPAQ questionnaire. Data referring to daily activity (minutes sitting and moderate and intense physical activity and number of steps taken) measured with the activity bracelet. Sleep-related: Sleep quality index, derived from the Pittsburg Sleep Quality Questionnaire (PSQI). Data referring to users' daily sleep (sleep duration, efficiency, start and end) measured with the activity bracelet. Related to the user's experience in using the application, evaluated through the UEQ questionnaire. Only at the end of the intervention. In total, subjects will receive 3 visits: Visit 0, pre-screening visit before randomization to check inclusion / exclusion criteria, using an online form. Visit 1, after randomization, inclusion visit. Participants will receive the activity bracelet and informed consent at their homes. During this visit, participants will answer the questionnaires using online forms. Visit 2, after three months, final visit of the study intervention.

Environmental factors, such as noise and light exposures contribute to the development of sleep disturbances in ICU. Hypnotics is the most prescribed treatment for managing ICU sleep; however, it only improves light sleep but not deep sleep, and could not deal with sleep disturbances caused by noise or light exposure. Purposes: To examine the effects of guided virtual reality autogenic meditation on sleep quality and quantity in critically ill adults as well as the possible mechanism through which they provide this alleviation. We hypothesize that critically ill adults undergoing guided virtual reality autogenic meditation (VR) will experience greater alleviations in sleep disturbances in comparison with participants in the eye masks and usual care control group (UC). Methods: The three-year, single-blinded randomized controlled trial will employ a three-arm parallel-group design. A total of 120 critical ill adults will be randomly allocated to the VR, Eye masks, or UC groups in a 1:1:1 ratio (40 participants in each group). For the VR group, all participants will experience 30-min, voice-guided autogenic meditation through head-mounted display device at 10 pm for 2 nights (ICU day 2 to day 4).

Therapeutic virtual reality (VR) has emerged as a promising and evidence-based treatment modality for cancer pain. Users of VR wear a pair of goggles with a close-proximity screen in front of the eyes that creates a sensation of being transported into lifelike, three-dimensional worlds. To date, VR has been limited to short-term clinical trials for cancer pain. Moreover, limited research exists on theory-based VR modalities beyond mere distraction, such as VR that employs acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT) with components of biofeedback and mindfulness. To bridge these gaps, this study seeks to: (1) assess the impact of immersive VR on patient-reported outcomes (PROs), including pain, activity metrics, and opioid use among patients with visceral pain from a digestive tract malignancy; (2) assess differences in PROs, activity metrics, and opioid use between skills-based VR therapy vs. distraction VR therapy; and (3) determine patient-level predictors of VR treatment response in visceral cancer pain. To address these aims, the study will measure PROs and opioid use in 360 patients randomized among 3 groups and follow them for 60 days after enrollment: (1) an enhanced VR group receiving skills-based VR; (2) a distraction-based VR group receiving patient-selected VR videos; and (3) a VR sham control group using a VR headset with 2-D content.

The efficacy and safety of these therapies have been determined primarily by randomized clinical trials that compared annualized rates of significant asthma exacerbations (SAEs), lung function changes, and standardized symptom survey score changes in therapy-treated subjects in comparison to placebo matched controls. Yet, there is increasing interest to assess the efficacy, health benefits, and safety in medical therapies using real-world evidence (RWE). Further, home monitoring of asthma using mobile health (mHealth) technology may help scientists develop new and more sensitive indicators of asthma control that could improve clinical care. The hypothesis is that real world evidence, collected at home using several mobile health technologies, will help determine the efficacy, health benefits, and side effects of these therapies. Objectives 1. Assess real-world evidence (RWE) indicators of worsening and improving asthma. Scientists will measure steps per day, duration and vigor of exercise per day, sleep quality, and the number of awakenings per night using Fitbit activity trackers. Scientists will measure symptoms using once-monthly custom survey delivered to participant smartphones via Twilio. Rescue medication use and adherence to maintenance medications may be measured using digital inhaler devices. Adherence to biologic use using HealthBeacon smart sharps containers may be measured. Measures collected will be correlated to patient-reported significant asthma exacerbations (SAEs), lung function (FEV1), and the asthma control test (ACT) collected in clinic every 3 months. 2.

Specifically, unhealthy alcohol use is common among persons living with HIV (PLWH) and increases the risk of developing negative outcomes. Antiretroviral therapy (ART) has shown increasing life expectancy and decreased HIV-related deaths, leading to a growing older adult HIV population. Yet, HIV accelerates the aging process and increases the risk for numerous chronic health conditions that compromise physical and mental health functioning and quality of life. Thus, PLWH continue to have shorter life expectancies relative to the general population and these multimorbidities explain this increased risk. In this context, unhealthy alcohol use among PLWH can further increase the risk for negative outcomes. Physical activity (PA) interventions can be used as an effective way to address unhealthy alcohol use among PLWH. Previous PA interventions have shown low generalizability and high loss to follow-up. Therefore, an intervention that is home-based, including lifestyle physical activity (LPA) with mobile health-delivered components is designed following the physical activity (PA) paradigm.

The investigator proposes a feasibility study to pilot a novel intervention titled Breathe Anew, which will aim to identify and overcome the barriers to the design and implementation of a lung cancer survivorship program. The investigator has assembled a multi-disciplinary team of experts and lung cancer survivors who will develop the Breathe Anew survivorship intervention. The intervention will be vetted using an integrated knowledge translation approach, which will involve members of the target population, primarily patients who previously underwent lung resection, to modify the intervention and ensure acceptability. After Breathe Anew has been designed, it will be tested in a pilot study of 50 patients to ensure its feasibility and determine its cost. The ultimate goal of this feasibility study is to lay the groundwork for a subsequent comparative trial to evaluate the impact of Breathe Anew on patient-important outcomes including health related quality and length of life and postoperative complications.

However, women live with physical and emotional side effects secondary to treatment for years after cancer treatments have ended. Exercise can help to manage these side effects, however, less than 30% of this population takes part in regular exercise. The objective of this trial is to determine the feasibility and effectiveness of a novel exercise and education program for women with breast cancer during chemotherapy. METHODS: Participants in this study include women with a diagnosis of stage 1 - 3 breast cancer undergoing chemotherapy. Women will be divided into three groups. The first group will include 8 sessions of exercise and self-management education during their chemotherapy treatment. The second group will receive self-management education only, and the third group will receive usual care. Outcomes will be compared between groups at baseline, post-intervention, and at 6- and 12- month follow up. Outcomes to be assessed include exercise level, functional mobility, muscle strength, quality of life, health status, and use of health care services. EXPECTED OUTCOMES: Women with breast cancer are among the least active segment of the Canadian population. It is well known that inactivity can lead to physical and psychological side effects, cancer recurrence, and an increase in comorbid conditions. This proposed project addresses a long-standing need to help women with breast cancer become and stay more active by implementing a novel exercise and education program.

Asian Americans (AA) are a fast-growing segment of the older adult U.S. population and are likely to have limited English proficiency, lower-incomes, and low PA levels. Older AA adults are under represented in clinical trials and as a result, evidence-based PA programs remain inaccessible. Similarly, while the number of PA interventions for older adults incorporating technology to promote and sustain behavior change is increasing, the applicability and efficacy of these approaches for AA is poorly understood. Thus, there is a critical need to develop and test innovative PA interventions for this at-risk group. The primary objective of this study is to evaluate if a culturally and linguistically adapted community-based walking program enhanced with a cognitive behavioral intervention delivered via WeChat - a widely used Chinese social networking application - (enhanced walking) improves physical activity compared with walking only. Secondary objectives are to identify participant experiences in engaging in this platform to improve PA, and gain insights into the scalability of the intervention for future pivotal trials.

Although some investigators advocate weight loss during pregnancy in obese women, these recommendations were based on extrapolation of retrospective epidemiological data. Of concern, we reported increased small for gestational age babies and decreased lean body mass in neonates of obese women with weight loss or inadequate gestational weight gain. Based on our research, optimal outcomes from lifestyle interventions are likely to be temporal and therefore must be initiated prior to conception to first improve maternal metabolic function, and subsequently, placental/fetal growth. Several large retrospective cohort studies support our hypothesis. For example, women who lost weight between pregnancies had fewer large for gestational age babies in contrast to women who increased interpregnancy weight. In addition, prospective randomized controlled trials have shown that postpartum weight loss is achievable without adverse maternal or neonatal outcomes, these studies include women who breastfed. Based on these observations, we propose a randomized control trial to determine the effect of lifestyle intervention initiated prior to a planned pregnancy on improving neonatal metabolism and adiposity. Our overarching hypothesis is that the maternal pre-pregnancy metabolic condition determines the obesogenic in-utero environment, which affects programming of placental mitochondrial function and metabolic pathways, promoting lipid accumulation and neonatal adiposity. Our rationale is based on the need to establish the most effective time to introduce an intervention that will break the obesity cycle in mothers and their children. Understanding how pregravid metabolic conditioning improves maternal physiology, and cellular and molecular function in pregnancy will provide the empirical data to support the intervention. We have a highly successful record of recruiting women who are planning a pregnancy, obtaining compliance in longitudinal studies, and in long-term follow-up of mothers and their offspring.

Current evidence suggests that PA, even without dietary prescription, can be efficacious in preventing T2D. Yet most Americans, especially those who are overweight/obese, are not physically active. Socioenvironmental barriers to physical activity (PA) such as body image concerns and limited access to fitness facilities contribute to the low levels of PA observed in overweight/obese adults. Web-based PA programs have been developed to address these barriers, but the outcomes have been marginal. Qualitative studies suggest that individuals who are overweight/obese prefer PA programs that feature people they can relate to especially in body size, fitness status and age. Previously, the investigators have included these preferences in a technology-based Physical Activity for The Heart (PATH) intervention that leverages open source platforms, such as YouTube, to promote PA in any setting. In this application, the investigators propose to test the feasibility and preliminary efficacy of PATH in promoting PA and reducing cardiometabolic risk in adults who are overweight/obese and at high risk of diabetes. In Aim 1 the investigators will conduct a 12-week randomized clinical trial including 52 adults who are overweight/obese and at high risk of diabetes to assess the feasibility and acceptability of PATH. In Aim 2 investigators will examine the trend in PA and cardiometabolic risk change from baseline to post-intervention. This approach is innovative because it leverages open source technologies to provide low-cost, action-oriented PA resources that match the preferences of adults who are overweight/obese. This contribution will be significant because PATH could offer a convenient, enjoyable and scalable program that features \""similar others\"" to promote PA in overweight/obese adults at high risk of diabetes.

Similarly, Hodgkin and non- Hodgkin lymphomas make up two of the most prevalent cancers in men and women. Even though remarkable improvements in cancer-free survival have been achieved in the last decades, the development of cardiac toxicity, associated with anthracycline-based chemotherapy (Anth-bC) counteracts the improvements in survival in these patient groups. One of the first clinical manifestation of Anth-bC cardiotoxicity is diastolic dysfunction, with further symptoms being left ventricular dysfunction and heart failure as well as a decline in exercise tolerance. Besides the direct cardiotoxic effects of anticancer treatment, many drugs also have adverse effects on the vascular endothelium. The concept of 'Exercise is Medicine' has become well established in exercise-oncology research. Exercise therapy is now considered a safe and well-tolerated adjunct therapy inducing beneficial effects on body composition, aerobic fitness and muscular strength, pain and fatigue, quality of life (QoL), depressive symptoms, and all cause survival. However, there is insufficient data on the superiority of performing exercise training therapy before and during chemotherapy with regard to cardiotoxic and cardiovascular side effects. Further, there is no data on patient preference for and barriers toward different timings of exercise training therapy. Therefore, the aim of the study is to compare left ventricular (LV) function measured by LV global longitudinal strain (GLS) in breast cancer and lymphoma patients undergoing Anth-bC randomised to completing an exercise-based rehabilitation programme during chemotherapy to those randomised to complete the programme after chemotherapy. Further, blood samples will be drawn to analyse biomarkers of myocardial injury (brain natriuretic peptide and high-sensitive cardiac troponin). Additional measurements include aortic distensibility as part of the echocardiographic examination and exercise capacity through cardiopulmonary exercise testing.

"""https://clinicaltrials.gov/show/NCT03851380"",","""Improving Brain Stimulation Through Imaging"",",""" Repetitive pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is a noninvasive treatment that involves stimulating the brain; however, treatment benefit depends on placing a TMS coil in the correct place on the head to reach critical brain regions below. Clinicians typically use scalp-based targeting, a process in which rather than using MRI guidance to target brain regions for stimulation, they use landmarks on the scalp. Several researchers, including the investigators' lab, showed that the current scalp-based targeting techniques do not position stimulation above the correct brain region, and patients fail to respond. The investigators propose to improve clinical scalp-based targeting by comparing it to MRI guided targeting. The most common clinical population receiving rTMS therapy is depressed patients. The investigators' plan is to study the accuracy of certain scalp-based rules in patients with depression. Accurate brain stimulation targeting is critical for effective rTMS therapy. For participants who are not undergoing rTMS therapy who have COVID-19 distress, we are offering a combined home-based neuromodulation (transcranial electrical stimulation) and focused psychotherapy program dedicated to improving the same outcome measure, quality of life. Transcranial electrical stimulation (tES) stimulates the brain over a large region; however, we are able to model with brain imaging which brain regions receive the strongest stimulation. Our goal is still to examine stimulation precision, but we will test whether strength of tES in the same brain regions that rTMS is targeting will also lead to improved quality of life. We will also carefully assess whether it is possible to measure healthy functioning, an outcome in the rTMS study, because sheltering in place may reduce activities and thus distort our measure. We will also test whether our psychotherapy intervention will mitigate this effect and, if so, we may make it available to all those depressed Veterans in whom we're studying the effect of neuromodulation on functioning.

PPCS results in greater utilization of sub-specialty care and can impact immediate and long-term social development, cognitive function and academic success. Previous recommendations for treating PPCS have focused on cognitive and physical rest, but more recently guidelines have shifted based on new research suggesting the benefit of rehabilitative exercise for PPCS. The rationale behind using exercise to treat youth with concussion is that gradually increasing physical activity facilitates return to full function. Rehabilitative exercise has since become one of the most common approaches to treating youth with PPCS, but access is challenging since most programs require weekly centralized visits with a concussion specialist. To bridge this gap, the investigators developed a telehealth-delivered approach to treat PPCS, utilizing physical activity trackers (Fitbits) and weekly video conferences with trained research staff. They then conducted a series of pilot studies with this approach, finding excellent feasibility, acceptability, and evidence for more rapid declines in concussive symptoms compared to controls. The investigators also found preliminary evidence that mechanisms behind this intervention may stem from both physiologic processes due to increased moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) and psychologic processes such as reducing fear- avoidance of concussive symptoms. They now propose a fully-powered randomized controlled trial (RCT) to asses the efficacy of the \""Mobile Subthreshold Exercise Program\"" (M-STEP) for treating youth with PPCS. "",",Other,,

As patients with T2DM often have insufficient knowledge about proper self-management and are insufficiently motivated for a lifestyle change, interventions with more motivational strategies and personalization are needed. The use of real-time monitoring of glucose values, nutrition and physical activity in combination with coaching aimed at lifestyle-related behavior change may improve patients' diabetes management. Therefore, ZGT, UT and RRD developed the Diameter app. The aim of phase 2 of this study is to investigate the Diameter as blended-care using a feasibility study. The primary objective of this feasibility study is to assess intervention usage and acceptability of the Diameter as a blended-care intervention in secondary care, of which some are also following a combined lifestyle intervention (GLI). Secondary objectives are to explore behavioral (e.g. physical activity), physiological (e.g. BMI), psychological (e.g. health-related quality of life) and clinical outcomes (e.g. glucose control, estimated HbA1c values). This study has a mixed-method design with 3 (regular participants) or 4 (participants who decide to follow the Combined Lifestyle Intervention (GLI) COOL next to the Diameter during the study period) data collection points.

These conditions are the major cause of ill health in the UK and cost the NHS billions of pounds each year. One long term condition that carries an enormous impact for patients and the NHS is COPD (Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease). This lung condition affects over one million patients in the UK and is one of the major causes of admission to hospital. Involvement of patients in the management of their own medical conditions (self-care) has been shown to improve how individuals feel, reduce the frequency of medical emergencies and reduce the costs of health care. In order to self-care successfully patients require the correct knowledge, skills and the confidence to make the right decisions; about their treatments, use of healthcare services and lifestyle choices. Recently the use of digital tools such as apps and websites has been shown to help patients with self-care and thus to improve their health. However in the UK there are very few providers of apps that are fully accredited by the NHS and only one that has been fully funded to provide apps nationally. My mhealth (short for my mobile health) is a UK company founded by NHS doctors which provides high quality digital tools (apps) to enable patients to access information about their condition and treatments and to record symptoms on their phones, tablets, computers or even smart TVs. MyMHealth has produced an app called MyCOPD which has been issued by the NHS to many thousands of patients in the UK. This was because it has been shown to improve the way patients with more severe COPD use their treatment and improved their day to day function through use of an online exercise programme. In this proposed study the MyMHealth team will work with NHS professionals to explore how an app called MyCOPD could help patients with mild disease and particularly those newly diagnosed with the condition. Investigators will explore how these patients can use the app and whether it's use can improve the ability to self-manage their condition.

Strong evidence has indicated that physical activity is associated with reduced risk of hypertension. Lifestyle change programs, including physical activity promotion and dietary modification, have been shown to effectively reduce the cumulative incidence of hypertension for individuals at-risk. However, it is challenging to maintain a high-level program. Recently, the consumer marketplace has been flooded with an array of wearable activity monitors, such Fitbit and Apple Watch, designed to enhance real time self-assessment and activity behavior change. These devices provide potential to serve as more cost effective and appealing intervention means for behavior change applications. Studies have examined the accuracy of the devices but little has been done to examine the monitors' feasibility as a behavior change strategy in and of themselves or as an adjunct to traditional methods (e.g., education and goal setting through a health coach), among people with hypertension. The real-time physical activity monitoring also provides an opportunity to build customized physical activity biofeedback for behavior change. Thus, there is an increasing interest to investigate their application as a behavior change strategy in isolation or as a complement to a more traditional intervention.

Similar interventions have shown to be very effective in older adults without cognitive impairment. We specifically focus on the subtype of amnestic mild cognitive impairment since this subtype often progresses to Alzheimer's Disease, a leading cause of death in the US. Improving physical activity is one approach to reduce the progression to Alzheimer's Disease and subsequently lower mortality. To increase the impact of the intervention, participants with amnestic mild cognitive impairment will be recruited along with a primary caregiver (dyads).

Unlike some other CGMs which allow a low (hypoglycaemic) and a high (hyperglycaemic) glucose alarm to be set, the DEXCOM One sensor has the unique feature of the 'Sustained Hyperglycaemic Alert', where the alarm is only activated if the glucose is above a certain threshold for a pre-specified amount of time. International consensus guidance states that people with diabetes should aim for 70% time in the range 3.9-10 mmol/L. After meals there is usually a rise in blood glucose, so it is not unexpected for the glucose to go above 10 mmol/L for a short time even if the insulin dose already given before a meal is correct. Therefore, people with a high glucose alarm set at 10 mmol/L on their GCM may unnecessarily inject extra insulin and risk a low blood glucose. However, DEXCOM One's Sustained Hyperglycaemic Alert would only notify patients if their blood sugar was high for a prolonged period, and so may reflect a time when it would be genuinely advantageous to inject more insulin.

However, evidence suggests that physical activity remains unchanged after TKR. This randomized clinical trial is investigating the efficacy, fidelity, and safety of a physical therapist administered physical activity intervention for people after TKR. Methods/Design: One hundred and twenty-five individuals, over the age of 45, who seek outpatient Physical Therapy (PT) following a unilateral TKR will be randomized into a control and intervention group. The intervention group will receive a weekly physical activity intervention during PT, which includes a FitbitTM monitor, individualized step goals, and face-to-face feedback provided by the physical therapist. Efficacy of the intervention will be measured by minutes/week spent in Moderate-to-Vigorous Physical Activity (MPVA) using an Actigraph GT3X monitor from enrollment to discharge, 6 months and 12 months from discharge from PT. The association of self-efficacy for exercise and kinesiophobia with physical activity will also be measured at the same time points. Fidelity and safety of the intervention will be assessed during outpatient PT. Discussion: This study is designed to fill a critical clinical need to increase physical activity after TKR. The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the efficacy of a physical therapist administered physical activity intervention for people after TKR. The secondary objectives are to evaluate the fidelity and safety of a physical therapist administered physical activity intervention for people after TKR and to investigate changes in self-reported and performance-based physical function after a physical therapist administered physical activity intervention for people after TKR. The tertiary objective is to explore the association of psychosocial factors with physical activity 6 and 12 months after discharge from a physical therapist administered physical activity intervention for people after TKR. The findings will be used to support a large multi-site clinical trial to test the effectiveness, implementation, and cost of this intervention. "",",General Physiology,,

Unfortunately, since physical activity support is not a part of standard survivorship care, few survivors have access to efficacious MVPA interventions. A key barrier to translation of MVPA promotion into care is the design of existing programs, which are resource-intensive, costly, and deliver multiple components (i.e., coaching calls, supervised exercise) simultaneously to all participants. This \""one-size-fits-all\"" approach does not account for individual needs, nor can it realistically be implemented into care.

While disease manifestations may vary amongst the spectrum of MPNs, quality of life considerations including fatigue, concentration difficulties, pain, sleep disturbance, and depression are negatively affected in most MPN patients. Inflammation has been suggested to be involved in the development of disease-related symptoms. Specific pro-inflammatory cytokines (e.g., IL-1, IL-6, IL-8, and TNF-\u03b1) have been associated with particular patient-reported symptoms, including fatigue, abdominal complaints, microvascular symptoms, and constitutional symptoms. Pharmacologic therapy can positively impact MPN related symptoms, specifically with JAK inhibition, however, these treatments often come with negative side effects (e.g., anemia, thrombocytopenia). Much opportunity remains for improving MPN symptoms (i.e., fatigue, insomnia, loss of muscle mass, and debilitation) and quality of life. Yoga, a gentle form of meditative exercise, has been shown to improve symptom management and quality of life parameters in cancer patients and may be effective in improving MPN-related symptoms.

The objective of this project is to develop personalized dynamical models of physical activity (PA) under different weather and temporal conditions as well as in response to different types of intervention messages. This approach relies on having extensive observations within the person under varying conditions to develop a dynamical model of how different conditions interact with each other to predict how behavior changes in response to text messages. Complementary sub-models will be estimated for each participant to describe their behavioral responses under different weather conditions. Healthy but insufficiently active young adults (n=80) will wear an activity monitor and receive a variety of randomly-timed and randomly-selected notifications via smartphone. GPS coordinates at the time of messages delivery and receipt are recorded and used to look up weather indices at that location at that time. The work is exploratory/descriptive as we will be developing models to describe participants' responses to messages under different weather conditions. This work is needed to develop the decision rules for a subsequent behavioral intervention that will be developed and tested in a future project. "",",General Physiology,,
"""https://clinicaltrials.gov/show/NCT03908099"",","""Fit-for-Fertility Multicenter Randomized Controlled Trial"",",""" Infertility affects approximately 10-15% of couples and one of its important modifiable risk factor is obesity, which affects 19% of Canadian women of reproductive age. Accordingly, many organizations have recommended that women should be assisted to adopt a healthy lifestyle prior to conception and maintain it during pregnancy. We therefore propose to conduct a multicenter randomized controlled trial (RCT) assessing the lifestyle intervention Fit-For-Fertility in women with infertility and obesity. Our hypothesis is that the Fit-For-Fertility program is an efficient and low cost solution to improve access to motherhood for women suffering from obesity and infertility. To test our hypothesis, seven fertility clinics having a good ethnic diversity will participate in this RCT and recruit a total of 616 women with obesity (BMI according to ethnicity) who consult at the fertility clinic. Participants will be randomly allocated to one of these two groups: the intervention group will be invited to participate in the Fit-for Fertility Program alone for 6 months and then in combination with usual fertility treatments; while the control group will receive standard fertility treatments from randomisation. The aim of the Fit-for Fertility Program will be to implement progressive and sustainable lifestyle changes, using 1) individual sessions with a dietitian and a kinesiologist every 6-12 weeks, for a total of 18 months or until the end of pregnancy; and 2) eight educational group sessions. Evaluation visits will take place prior to randomisation and then every 6 months for 18 months. Women who become pregnant will be evaluated early during pregnancy and at 26 weeks of gestation. Clinical outcomes will be assessed after a total follow up of 24 months. Anticipated contributions: The results of our multicenter RCT will provide important data on the importance of a lifestyle program supporting women with obesity consulting in fertility clinics, in order to improve their fertility and response to ART, as well as helping them to have a healthy baby. This study will also provide valuable information on potential cost savings for individuals and the healthcare system. "",",Bariatrics,Obstetrics,

The main question it aims to answer are: 1. Does PBM significantly affect health and well-being? 2. Are PBM effects wavelength dependent? 3. Are PBM effects pulse dependent? 4. Are the eyes needed to assert an PBM effect or is exposure only to the skin sufficient? 5. What are the cellular, metabolic pathways underlying the systemic effects of PBM. Participants will have to: 1. Exposed themselves 5 times per week during 2 weeks to the PBM stimuli between 9:30 and 12:30. 2. A week before the baseline measurement, participants will have to start wearing a Fitbit Versa 3, and will have to continuously wear until the end of the study. 3. In the afternoon of the baseline day as well as in the afternoons after 5 and 10 PBM sessions (week 1 and week 2, respectively), participants will have to go to the lab for blood withdraw. 4. In the evening of the baseline day as well as in the evenings after 5 and 10 PBM sessions (week 1 and week 2, respectively), participants will have to collect saliva samples as well as to complete questionnaires.

Exercise has been shown to be effective in preventing repeat heart attacks, hospitalizations and death among heart attack survivors (Lawler et al., 2011). But, few heart attack survivors -- particularly women -- get the recommended amount of physical activity (Minges et al., 2017; Gorczyca et al., 2017). The goal of this pilot study is to test the potential of an innovative new doctor-led exercise program to improve physical activity and quality of life for women who have had heart attacks in the past. Women who take part in the study will be randomly assigned to participation in the exercise program (which will consist of three 45-minute exercise sessions on Zoom per week) or usual care (attending medical appointments and following doctors' recommendations). All participants will be asked to wear Fitbit activity trackers to track steps every day, to use blood pressure cuffs to measure blood pressure at home, and complete a brief set of surveys at the beginning of the study, after 4 weeks, and after 12 weeks. Additionally, 10 people in the exercise group group will be asked to participate in brief interviews after the program for feedback on the program. "",",Cardiology,,
