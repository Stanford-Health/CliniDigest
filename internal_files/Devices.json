            "Links between sleep and food intake are manyfold. In healthy individuals, sleep deprivation promotes obesity by stimulating food intake of high glycemic index (GI) foods. Conversely, high GI foods induce sleepiness. Obesity is observed in 30-50% of patients with Narcolepsy type 1 (NT1). Its determinism may involve transient changes in basal metabolism at the early stage of the disease, eating disorders, disrupted nighttime sleep and sleepiness. In contrast, patients suffering from idiopathic hypersomnia (IH), whose nocturnal sleep is generally long and of good quality, rarely present with obesity. By studying the relationships between diet, body composition and sleep patterns in these two populations and in healthy controls, the NARCOFOOD study aims to provide a better understanding of the determinants of obesity in narcolepsy and, more generally, of the effects of food intake on sleepiness.\n\nPatients will be recruited at the Lyon and Clermont-Ferrand sleep centers and Controls at the Lyon Neuroscience Research Center. Data from clinical evaluation (including body mass index and body composition), and questionnaires (sleep quality, insomnia, sleepiness, anxiety and depression, impulsivity, eating behaviors) will be collected. During 4 days, at home, the following parameters will be explored : 1) eating behaviors (meals' photos) and sugar consumption (FreeStylePro sensor measuring interstitial glucose) 2) sleep/wake rhythm (diary and actigraphy) 3) nocturnal sleep parameters (Somfit device) 4) sleepiness (Karolinska sleepiness scale and EEG markers of sleepiness with the Somfit device) before and after meals.\n\nThe hypothesis is that increased sleepiness would favor food intake of high GI foods, which would worsen sleepiness in all 3 groups, with a more pronounced effect in NT1. Compared to IH patients and controls, NT1 patients may present more snacking of high GI foods, especially at night if sleep is disrupted, and this would be correlated with body composition.\n\nThe findings will help to better understand the mechanisms of obesity in narcolepsy and may lay the ground for the development of new therapeutic strategies in disorders of hypersomnolence, targeting dietary behaviors."

The condition is associated with adverse outcomes for mother and baby during both the pregnancy and delivery period. This study compares glucose variability (recorded by a continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) sensor) in pregnant women who have been diagnosed with GDM with pregnant woman who do not have the diagnosis but are at high risk. The sensors will be applied to 400 participants around the time of their standard test for GDM, with a randomly selected 60 of these patients forming a sub-group later in the study to assess for progression of high blood glucose. At present, a positive oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) is used to confirm the diagnosis of GDM but the test can be unreliable leading to potential diagnostic error. CGM devices are used extensively in the management of Type 1 diabetes and GDM, and have also shown potential to be used in the diagnosis of Type 2 diabetes.\n\nIf this study can demonstrate similar trends in glucose variability between OGTT positive patients and those who are OGTT negative but are at high risk for the condition, then further research into the utility of CGM as a diagnostic alternative or supplement to the OGTT would be indicated.\n\nThe investigators will recruit 400 patients at high risk for GDM, give them a blinded CGM device, and compare the CGM glucose data with their OGTT result, their initial risk factors for GDM, their pregnancy outcome and their need for treatment. The investigators will use the data to test our hypothesis that a positive OGTT result does not predict hyperglycaemia in pregnancy."

The comparison is conducted to determine whether a continuous glucose monitoring system is superior to traditional fingerstick glucose monitoring in terms of better glucose level management, patient satisfaction and experience, nursing staff workload and management experience, as well as in preventing complications. Furthermore, the accuracy of blood glucose values for continuous blood glucose monitoring is compared to fingerstick glucose monitoring and blood samples. The study's hypothesis is that continuous glucose monitoring systems are accurate and usable for measuring glucose levels in patients in a surgical ward. This will result in better glycemic control, thereby reducing complications and shortening hospital stays.

The intervention uses real-time glucose data sharing with a Follower (family member, friend, or caregiver) and personalized diabetes education provided to the dyad (person with T1DM and their chosen Follower). The study hypothesizes that the FAM intervention will reduce the percentage of time spent with glucose \u2265250 mg/dL compared to standard care alone."

            "Use of Continuous Glucose Monitoring Devices Among People Living With Type 1 Diabetes in South Africa",
            "Diabetes mellitus (diabetes) is a chronic condition that represents a major public health and clinical concern. Self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG) is a critical part of the care of individuals with diabetes. SMBG entails capillary fingerstick blood glucose testing multiple times per day. Many people with diabetes find this testing painful and cumbersome, often resulting in poor compliance to a glucose self-monitoring schedule. Furthermore, SMBG only provides limited visibility on daily and nightly glucose profiles, meaning that hypo- and hyperglycaemic episodes can be missed or detected with delay. The use of minimally invasive continuous glucose monitoring devices (CGMs) in diabetes management circumvents these challenges as CGMs measure glucose every few minutes over a period of 1-2 weeks through a sensor with a fine needle that is inserted once into a user's arm or abdomen. This enables periodic glucose measurement without repeat finger pricks and provides the user with a detailed glucose profile over the entire wear time of the sensor, thus enabling better adjustment of therapy or behaviour.\n\nIn populations where CGMs are accessible to people with diabetes as standard of care and without additional cost, many people with type 1 diabetes have switched from SMBG via fingerstick to the use of CGMs permanently, using the devices continuously. This is rarely possibly for people with type 1 diabetes in the public sector in LMICs as CGMs are not provided as standard of care. Little data on effectiveness, feasibility, acceptability, and cost of the use of CGMs in LMIC populations is available to inform clinical models for the integration of CGMs into diabetes management. Furthermore, it has not been investigated if intermittent, as opposed to continuous use of CGMs provides clinical benefit. Intermittent use could be beneficial for people with diabetes who do not have the means to pay for continuous use of CGMs.\n\nThis study aims to evaluate the effectiveness, feasibility, acceptability, and cost of intermittent and continuous use of CGM among people with type 1 diabetes in South Africa."

The investigators are searching for ways to make the beneficial effects of RYGB available to most type 2 diabetes patients rather than a select few that undergo RYGB.\n\nThe investigators believe that parts of RYGB can be medically reproduced through a combination of diet and medicine. Once weekly injectable GLP-1 medicine that leads to weight loss and improved blood sugar control in type 2 diabetes are now FDA approved. Optifast is a medically supervised diet that safely reduces calorie intake to 800 calories per day for three months by replacing normal meals with specially prepared bars and shakes which leads to weight loss and improved blood sugar control in type 2 diabetes. Normal meals are then gradually reintroduced over 6 weeks and the bars/shakes are stopped.

It can be indicative of (i) Type 2 Diabetes or (ii) stress hyperglycaemia (diagnostic threshold for blood sugar varies according to learned societies, with HbA1c \\< 6.5%).\n* Hyperglycaemia occurs in known diabetic ACS subjects Most studies use admission blood sugar as a predictor. However, it has recently been shown that glycemic variability indexes would be better predictors of MACE. Using continuous glucose measurement for 48 h, it has been shown that significant glycemic variability is a more powerful predictor of MACE at 1 year than admission glycemia The measurement of glycemic variability is mainly possible thanks to the development of CGM (continuous glucose measurement).\n\nTo our knowledge, no study has been interested in evaluating the predictive value of the various glycemic parameters measured by CGM.\n\nPublished studies have used continuous glucose measurements for very short periods (24 or 72 hours maximum), which limits these measurements.\n\nThe freestyle libre Pro iQ (FSLPro iQ) is a professional sensor for continuous, non-invasive interstitial glucose measurement allowing the recording of glycemic parameters for 2 weeks.\n\nOur hypothesis is that glycaemic parameters, alone or in combination with each other or with other patient risk factors, measured with the Freestyle libre Pro iQ have a significant prognostic value in terms of cardiovascular clinical events at 12 months in a population of patients with ACS managed as standard and followed up."

            "Type 1 diabetes (T1D) results from destruction of insulin producing beta cells by the body's own immune system (autoimmunity) causing an individual to lose the ability to make enough insulin to control their blood sugar levels and need to have insulin injections to lower blood glucose levels. Whilst high blood sugar level is a problem for people with Type 1 diabetes, taking insulin medication to lower sugar levels, delayed meals and exercise can all result in dangerously low blood sugar levels (hypoglycaemia). The biological causes of hypoglycaemia, and ways to prevent it are poorly understood. In non-diabetic individuals, a hormone called glucagon is secreted naturally to raise blood glucose levels but it is unclear why glucagon secretion is impaired during hypoglycaemia in individuals with T1D.\n\nThe aim of this prospective observational study is to test the relationship between a glucagon stimulation test and risk of hypoglycaemia in T1D. It is hoped this research will establish whether this relationship could be used as a blood test and be a clinically useful biomarker of hypoglycaemia risk and, therefore, directly inform clinical care of people with T1D, particularly those with highest risk of hypoglycaemia.\n\nAssessment of beta cell decline has traditionally relied on timed C-peptide measures following a standardised liquid meal known as the mixed meal tolerance test (MMTT). Home finger prick blood spot C-peptide measurement might be a practical, cheap, and non-invasive alternative to a MMTT and would allow regular assessment of beta cell function over time. If proven that this sample type is a robust alternative to the gold standard MMTT venous C-peptide, it would dramatically decrease the cost and participant burden of T1D research into beta cell function."

            "Introduction\n\n16.8% of the Danish adult population are obese (Body Mass Index\\> 30 kg / m2). Obesity increases the risk of lifestyle diseases such as type-2 diabetes and non-alcoholic fatty liver. People with mental illness have an increased risk of developing obesity. Both obesity and certain mental disorders (bipolar disorder and schizophrenia) are associated with circadian rhythm disorders. Clinically, this may manifest as reduced sleep quality, depressive symptoms and increased fatigue, but also deregulation of a wide range of bodily processes subject to the circadian rhythm.\n\nIn circadian rhythm disorders, the pattern of how mRNA of specific 'clock genes' is expressed in the cell may be affected. These clock genes are associated with obesity, bipolar disorder and schizophrenia. Despite the clear indications of an interplay between mental illness, obesity and circadian rhythm disorders, the relationship between these illnesses are largely unexplored.\n\nAim\n\nThe aim of this study is to investigate circadian disturbances in people with and without obesity, as well as people with obesity and a comorbid diagnosis of either schizophrenia or bipolar disorder.\n\nMethods\n\nThe study population will consist of:\n\n1. People with obesity and schizophrenia (N=22)\n2. People with obesity and bipolar disorder (N=22)\n3. People with obesity without psychiatric disease (N=22)\n4. People with BMI 18.5 - 25kg/m2 and no psychiatric disease (N=20)\n\nStudy Procedure\n\nParticipants will visit the clinic 2 times. At each visit participants fill in questionnaires and perform physical tests. Between visit 1 and 2, participants will over a 2-day period (at-home), collect biological samples (Four hair- and six saliva samples per day). In addition, participants will wear accelerometers and continuous glucose monitors (CGMs) for a total of 8 days, including the 2-day sampling period.\n\nSampled hair follicles are analyzed for relative expression of clock gene mRNA. Saliva is analyzed for cortisol- and melatonin content. The four participants groups are analyzed and compared on daytime variation in mRNA expression, cortisol- and melatonin concentration, and body temperature.\n\nPerspectives\n\nA comparison of patient groups presenting with mental disease, obesity and circadian disturbances may provide new insight into the association between these diseases."

In CF clinical decline due to dysglycemia begins early, prior to diagnosis of diabetes and increases mortality from pulmonary disease. There is presently no way to determine who, of those with dysglycemia, will experience clinical compromise. However, the CF Center in Milan has found that measurable age- and sex-dependent variables on oral glucose tolerance testing (OGTT) predict \u03b2-cell failure-the primary driver of decline in CF. the investigators propose a multi-center trial to develop nomograms of age and sex dependent reference values for OGTT-derived measures including glucose, insulin, c-peptide, and the resultant OGTT-derived estimates of \u03b2-cell function, \u03b2 cell sensitivity to glucose, and oral glucose insulin sensitivity (OGIS) and to determine correlation of these with clinical status (FEV-1, BMI z score, number of pulmonary exacerbations over the past 12 months).

Investigators will allocate 1,000 participants from Pyeongchang-gun into two groups: one with diabetes (and pre-diabetes) and one with hypertension (including borderline cases), focusing on poorly controlled patients. As participants visit local health centers, their data will be sent to the research team for blocked randomization based on disease type, severity, and region. Assignment results will be communicated back to the centers and patients.\n\nStudy setting The intervention will take place in Pyeongchang-gun, Kangwon-do, South Korea. The Smart Healthcare Center affiliated to Public Medical Center of Pyeongchang will primarily manage the O2O service by providing necessary education and human resources while receiving and monitoring data from each participant and local medical centers. The overall study (including the design of trial) is managed by Seoul National University College of Medicine while the provision of O2O service and data collection are primarily in charge of Smart Healthcare Center of Pyeongchang.\n\nIntervention in O2O Service Model:\n\nAfter initial health exams, each patient gets a custom care plan, classifying their disease and care level. The Pyeongchang Smart Healthcare Center, with doctors, tracks patients via an online platform, sending automated health messages. High-risk patients receive a two-week glucose monitor and guidance on lifestyle adjustments. Doctors access patient health records through the participant's personal online datastore (POD), with consent, integrating health and prescription history from national insurance, and can assess heart disease risk.\n\nSample size The trial's sample size is determined using the MDES(Minimum Detectable Effect Size), with 1,000 participants divided equally between diabetes and hypertension groups. Each group is then split into treatment and control subgroups through random allocation. The MDES calculation, accounting for an explained outcome variation of 50% due to blocking and controls, and based on 500 subjects per group with equal allocation, aims for a high-accuracy effect size of 0.216 at a 5% significance level and 80% power.\n\nAssignment of interventions: allocation Participants will be randomly placed into groups by a computer program. This study uses a specific randomization method that is restricted and organized by individual characteristics. The research team will tell the centers and patients about their group assignment via phone and email. Neither the healthcare staff nor the participants will know the group allocation beforehand. The research team is in charge of the randomization process and informing everyone involved. The staff at Pyeongchang's Smart Healthcare Center will sign up participants and manage their placement into the assigned intervention groups. There will be no blinding after participants are assigned to their groups.\n\nList of Data For the study, the investigators have created questionnaires and interview formats to collect various data types, including random assignment records, baseline information, outcomes, service usage and costs, demographic and health details, physician-collected health records, life-log data from apps or web, clinical exam results, and service effectiveness and efficiency from the perspective of medical staff and administrators.\n\nStatistical methods For the analysis of primary and secondary outcomes, the investigators will employ ITT(Intention-to-Treat) and Regression-Adjusted Impact Estimate. When data allows (especially data from control group), the investigators will also conduct timeseries effect analysis. To investigate the time-series changes in program effects across multiple time points, the dependent variable (outcome variable) should be measured at each time point to estimate program effects repeatedly.\n\nData management and monitoring The data management for the study will be conducted using electronic systems for secure and accurate data entry, coding, and storage, with robust checks and backups to ensure data quality, which will be archived for three years in compliance with bioethics standards before disposal according to privacy regulations. Participant confidentiality is prioritized through secure data collection and restricted access, with sharing only to authorized research team members and regulators using password protection or encryption. Additionally, a dedicated Data Monitoring Committee will oversee trial progress and adherence to protocols, while the Smart Healthcare Center collaborates with healthcare workers to manage patient services, with minimal adverse events expected."

            "Use of Continuous Glucose Monitoring Devices Among People Living With Type 1 Diabetes in Kenya.",
            "Diabetes mellitus (diabetes) is a chronic condition that represents a major public health and clinical concern. Self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG) is a critical part of the care of individuals with diabetes. SMBG entails capillary fingerstick blood glucose testing multiple times per day. Many people with diabetes find this testing painful and cumbersome, often resulting in poor compliance to a glucose self-monitoring schedule. Furthermore, SMBG only provides limited visibility on daily and nightly glucose profiles, meaning that hypo- and hyperglycaemic episodes can be missed or detected with delay. The use of minimally invasive continuous glucose monitoring devices (CGMs) in diabetes management circumvents these challenges as CGMs measure glucose every few minutes over a period of 1-2 weeks through a sensor with a fine needle that is inserted once into a user's arm or abdomen. This enables periodic glucose measurement without repeat finger pricks and provides the user with a detailed glucose profile over the entire wear time of the sensor, thus enabling better adjustment of therapy or behaviour.\n\nIn populations where CGMs are accessible to people with diabetes as standard of care and without additional cost, many people with type 1 diabetes have switched from SMBG via fingerstick to the use of CGMs permanently, using the devices continuously. This is rarely possibly for people with type 1 diabetes in the public sector in LMICs as CGMs are not provided as standard of care. Little data on effectiveness, feasibility, acceptability, and cost of the use of CGMs in LMIC populations is available to inform clinical models for the integration of CGMs into diabetes management. Furthermore, it has not been investigated if intermittent, as opposed to continuous use of CGMs provides clinical benefit. Intermittent use could be beneficial for people with diabetes who do not have the means to pay for continuous use of CGMs.\n\nThis study aims to evaluate the effectiveness, feasibility, acceptability, and cost of intermittent and continuous use of CGM among people with type 1 diabetes in Kenya."

The primary independent variable will be the HbA1C from baseline to 6 and 12 months. Patients will serve as their own control. Results will be summarized as group-specific mean, standard deviation (SD) HbA1c, along with a mean treatment difference and 95% confidence interval. Model assumptions including normality and homoscedasticity of residuals will be evaluated; normalizing transformations or rank-based non-parametric procedures will be used as needed. The complete evaluation of HbA1c, including baseline, 6-month and 12 month measurements will be analyzed with mixed effects linear regression, specifying a random participant-level intercept and an unstructured covariance matrix, to accommodate the repeatedly measured data. The secondary trial outcomes of time in range (TIR; CGM glucose levels 70-180) and questionnaires will be compared from baseline to 6 and 12 months using linear regression procedures as detailed above."

People with T1D use insulin replacement therapy, usually in the form of injections, to help control blood glucose levels, however keeping glucose levels within normal ranges is usually a challenge. Mealtime glucose control is fundamental to good diabetes management and are an important contributor to long-term diabetes complications. However, many individuals experience variability in glucose levels around mealtimes. The objective of this study is to establish whether and which parameters are important predictors of mealtime glucose levels in people with T1D.\n\nThe investigators will monitor glucose levels using the latest glucose monitoring technology and collect blood samples to:\n\n1. Characterise changes in glucose levels in individuals with T1D in response to different meals\n2. Determine whether and what food characteristics and personal factors are linked to individual glucose responses to different meals.\n\nThe investigators will recruit 150 individuals with type 1 diabetes.

Study findings will ultimately determine how often and for how long people should break up periods of prolonged sedentary time to transiently improve established cardiovascular risk factors; key foundational information critical to the success of future long-term trials and ultimately public health guidelines.\n\nPrimary Aim: To determine the minimally effective dose combination(s) of frequency and duration needed to provide cardiometabolic benefit during an 8-hour experimentation period. Specifically, the study will determine:\n\n1a. For each fixed duration, the minimum sedentary break frequency (e.g., every 30 min, 60 min, 120 min) that demonstrates a reduction in systolic BP, diastolic BP, or glucose compared with a sedentary control condition.\n\n1b. For each fixed frequency, the minimum sedentary break duration (e.g., activity breaks of 1 min, 5 min, 10 min) that demonstrates a reduction in systolic BP, diastolic BP, or glucose compared with a sedentary control.\n\nSecondary Aim: It is also critical to public health strategy to assess the acceptability/feasibility of various sedentary break doses as too high a dose will yield poor uptake. To address this need, the maximally tolerated dose (the highest dose that does not cause undue physical/psychological distress) for frequency and duration of sedentary breaks will also be determined via assessment of 4 constructs: physical exhaustion/fatigue, affect (e.g., mood, emotion), tolerability (e.g., completion of dose protocol), and safety (e.g., hypoglycemia).

            "Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is glucose intolerance diagnosed for the first time in pregnancy. According to literature GDM affects 3-10% of pregnant women and is a risk factor for multiple maternal and fetal complications. During pregnancy GDM significantly increases the risk of fetal macrosomia, shoulder dystocia, birth trauma and Cesarean section. Furthermore, the long-term complications of GDM include increased risk of development of diabetes mellitus type 2 in the mother, as well as increased risk of obesity, diabetes and metabolic syndrome occurrence in their children. It has been well-documented that the risk of above-mentioned complications increases with the level of maternal hyperglycemia.\n\nProper glycemia control is one of the key elements in the effective treatment of GDM. Until recently, glucose monitoring was solely performed using glucose meters, which required multiple fingerpricks. Nowadays, due to the glycemia monitoring systems development, such as flash glucose monitoring (FGM), glucose levels may be measured less invasively through subcutaneous sensor application. As shown in one of the studies, FGM due to the ease of use, was 3 times more often applied as a method of glycemia control than SMBG. As a result, patients from FGM group had significantly better blood glucose control.\n\nThe main purpose of our study is to evaluate the impact of new method of glycemia control (FGM) on the efficacy of treatment of GDM. By analyzing results of this study, such as mean glycemia levels, number of women requiring insulin therapy and maternal-fetal perinatal outcomes the investigators will provide a scientific basis for more common use of FGM in the population of pregnant women affected by GDM."

            "Rationale of the study: Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is very common and the rate of women suffering from it expected to increase in the next years. It is associated with maternal and fetal morbidity and the risk is correlated to the patient's degree of glucose control which can be achieved through a change in lifestyle or medication. Several studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of mobile apps in improving obstetric outcomes in GDM. In addition, the LUMEN device is a breathing device that produces dietary and exercise recommendations based on CO2 levels and improves metabolic parameters in patients with type 2 diabetes. No work has been done on its effectiveness in treating GDM. Aims of the study: Comparison of metabolic outcomes in women with gestational diabetes, with or without the use of LUMEN app. Design: This will be an open label parallel group 1:1 randomized-controlled trial Methods: the investigators will recruit women diagnosed with GDM. The women will be randomized to the intervention arm that will use the LUMEN device and app or to the control arm that will use a free mobile tracking app. The women will be required to monitor their blood sugar levels daily and to have GDM follow-up in the feto-maternal outpatient clinic, as is customary in GDM. After the birth, the maternal and neonatal outcome will be recorded. Based on past research data, a recruitment of 170 is needed to demonstrate a 16.7% decrease in insulin use to balance diabetes, with \u03b1 = 0.05 and \u03b2 = 80."

However, it should be noted that recommendations for atrial fibrillation screening are controversial, and several organizations and communities do not recommend screening outside of at-risk groups.\n\nSome smart device manufacturers do not recommend using the ECG function for anyone under the age of 22. However, young people are frequent users of wearable devices. One of the most common cardiologic diseases at the age of 18-30 is benign heart rhythm disorder, which often does not require diagnosis or treatment and can be considered normal.\n\nThat said, notification of the detection of atrial fibrillation can affect psycho-emotional well-being, particularly anxiety.\n\nThis study will assess the level of psycho-emotional health (anxiety level) of the study participants. Participant observation will provide an opportunity to identify associations between the use of the ECG recording function on wearable devices and levels of anxiety and depression. It is hypothesized that the use of smartwatches with the ECG function activated will not lead to a change in anxiety levels on the GAD-7 scale among the study participants. This assumes that after 30 days of use, the mean value of the GAD-7 scale in the intervention group and the control group will be the same."

Currently, these devices can be used for monitoring and possible early diagnosis of abnormalities in order to prevent health complications and bring about better outcomes, as well as monitor the user's progress and thus prevent more serious developments. Objective: to analyze, in patients with cardiovascular disease, the electrocardiographic aspects detected from the device in comparison to the conventional electrocardiogram, identifying aspects of similarity between the tracings obtained and automatic diagnostic accuracy by the device and by the visual assessment of the tracing. Method: a cross-sectional observational study of diagnostic accuracy will be carried out at the University Hospital of the Federal University of Piaui. The following parameters were considered: significance level of 95%, test power of 80%, value of the disease diagnosis rate of 84%, area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 94% and an equal proportion of the number of positive and negative cases. The minimum sample size consisted of 100 patients, and an additional 10% will be added to compensate for possible losses. A total of 110 patients will be invited to participate in the study. Patients aged \u2265 18 years will be included, with the presence of one or more diagnoses below: systemic arterial hypertension, heart failure, valvular disease, coronary atherosclerotic disease, myocardial infarction, endocarditis, myocarditis, diabetes, cardiac arrhythmias and patients with cardiac pace or implantable automatic defibrillator.

            "Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common arrhythmia affecting 1.3 million people in the UK. AF causes an irregular and fast heartbeat, which makes the heart pump poorly. As a result, blood clots may form inside the heart and, if they travel to the brain, can lead to an AF-related stroke. Patients with AF have a risk of stroke five-times higher than patients with normal rhythm.\n\nAnticoagulants make the blood less likely to clot and, thus, reduce the chances of an AF-related stroke. For most people, once anticoagulation is started it must be taken for the rest of their lives irrespective of the amount of AF someone has. However, anticoagulants make patients more prone to bleeding.\n\nNew studies have reported a lower stroke risk in patients with short and infrequent AF episodes. If there are long time gaps in between AF episodes, short periods of anticoagulation around the time of AF may be enough to avoid clots from forming and reducing the overall risk of bleeding. To use anticoagulants only when needed will require an accurate and reliable way to detect AF when it occurs and alert patients. New technologies, such as small heart monitors placed under the skin, watches and rings, can track the heart rhythm continuously and send real-time alerts to patients via mobile phone message if AF is detected.\n\nThe purpose of this study is to investigate if implantable cardiac monitors (LINQ II) and wearable devices (Apple Watch and CART-I ring) can detect AF episodes, send real-time alerts to patients and who will respond to these alerts within a short timeframe. The investigators will recruit 50 patients and follow them for six months. All participants will receive a LINQ II and a wearable device."

This study is a randomized controlled trial pilot study to evaluate the effectiveness of an intervention (FAM) using a Follower, Action Plan, and Remote Monitoring of glucose data to reduce severe hyperglycemia, a modifiable risk factor for DKA, in adults with T1DM at high risk for DKA. The intervention uses real-time glucose data sharing with a Follower (family member, friend, or caregiver) and personalized diabetes education provided to the dyad (person with T1DM and their chosen Follower). The study hypothesizes that the FAM intervention will reduce the percentage of time spent with glucose \u2265250 mg/dL compared to standard care alone."

            "Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is an X-linked disorder that causes muscle wasting, cardiopulmonary failure, and premature death. Heart failure is a leading cause of death in DMD, but substantial knowledge gaps exist regarding predisposing risk factors. In the general population, hyperglycemia, insulin resistance, and decreased heart rate variability (HRV; reflecting autonomic dysfunction) are associated with cardiomyopathy (CM). It is unclear whether these factors are associated with DMD-CM. Closing this knowledge gap may lead to novel screening and therapeutic strategies to delay progression of DMD-CM, now the leading cause of death in patients with DMD. Despite risk factors for hyperglycemia, including the use of glucocorticoids (GCs), sarcopenia, obesity, and reduced ambulation, little is known regarding glucose abnormalities in DMD. Some of these same risk factors, along with the distance needed to travel for specialty care, present significant barriers to research participation and clinical care for individuals with DMD. Remote wearable technology may improve research participation in this vulnerable population. Therefore, this study will leverage remote wearable technologies to overcome these barriers and define the relationship between dysglycemia and DMD-CM.\n\nThe goal of this remote study is to evaluate rates of hyperglycemia in individuals with DMD compared to control participants using continuous glucose monitors, and to determine the relationship between hyperglycemia and heart rate variability. Participants will utilize continuous glucose monitors, cardiac monitors, and activity monitors to evaluate glucose levels, heart rate, activity, and sleep."

            "There is a fundamental gap in understanding the maternal and neonatal effects of antenatal corticosteroid (ACS) administration in women with threatened preterm birth (PTB) who have diabetes. Since the initial discovery of ACS for neonatal benefit in 1972, more than 40 randomized controlled trials have been performed evaluating its efficacy. However, none of these trials have included women with T2DM, and there is limited data among women with gestational diabetes. While ACS have been shown to reduce neonatal morbidity associated with PTB in non-diabetic women, the side effects of ACS (maternal hyperglycemia and fetal hyperinsulinemia) may mitigate the neonatal benefit of ACS in women with diabetes. Before neonatal benefit of ACS can be evaluated in this population, the first step is to optimize maternal glycemic control after ACS. Previous studies evaluating maternal hyperglycemia after ACS have been limited by small sample size, retrospective study design, or insufficient glucose data. Use of continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) in a randomized clinical trial provides a unique opportunity to overcome these challenges. Our long-term goal is to improve maternal and child health among women with diabetes as an independently funded clinical researcher. The research objectives of this proposal are to test the efficacy of three treatment strategies at achieving maternal glycemic control after ACS and evaluate the association between maternal glycemic control and neonatal outcomes. Our central hypothesis is that treatment with a continuous insulin infusion will improve maternal glycemic control, which is key to improving neonatal outcomes, but at the cost of less patient satisfaction and more health resource utilization. This hypothesis will be tested by pursuing the following specific aims: 1) Test the efficacy of three treatment strategies (addition of sliding scale insulin, up-titration of home insulin, and continuous insulin infusion) at achieving maternal glycemic control after ACS and 2) Quantify the association between maternal glycemic control after ACS and neonatal morbidity. Completion of these aims will determine the optimal strategy to achieve maternal glycemic control after ACS and inform a larger, multicenter trial to improve neonatal outcomes among women with diabetes and threatened PTB."

            "Glucose control during labor is important for both fetus and mother. During labor and delivery, the goal is to maintain the sugars in the normal range as safely as possible as increased blood sugars 4-6 h prior to delivery leads to increased rates of hypoglycemia in the neonate. Neonatal hypoglycemia is a risk for the offspring of pregnant women with diabetes and occurs when fetal pancreatic hyperplasia is acutely stimulated by a high fetal glucose level derived from maternal hyperglycemia during labor. The maternal blood glucose level during delivery is a predictor of the neonatal blood glucose level. Modern continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) systems can capture the direction and magnitude of short-lived changes in interstitial glucose levels and are therefore useful for assessing glucose variability more accurately than self-monitoring blood glucose (SMBG) measurements. Indeed, it has already been demonstrated that intermittent blood glucose monitoring underestimates the number of hyperglycemic events, because blood glucose excursions can peak at different times of day. CGMs can help identify glycemic patterns in pregnancy, obtain and maintain glucose targets, and reduce hypoglycemia. Strict glycemic control during labor and delivery may reduce the risk of neonatal hypoglycemia. Two groups have reported on the use of CGM in type 1 diabetics during labor in small pilot studies. Another study looked at effects of maternal glucose levels in insulin-treated women during labor and delivery (2 to 8 h before birth) and resultant neonatal hypoglycemia. The researchers found that maternal hyperglycemia before delivery was correlated with neonatal hypoglycemia. Although more studies are needed, CGM use has promise as a therapy to improve outcomes in pregnancies associated with diabetes. In this study, the investigators plan to explore whether the use of blinded glucose monitoring during labor, delivery, and early postpartum supplementary to normally monitored plasma glucose measurements in women with gestational diabetes (GDM) would provide useful information to improve glycemia during labor in this diabetic population. All CGM data will be masked and therefore not available to participants, clinicians, or researchers at the time of delivery. Participants otherwise will receive standard clinical care. The blinded glucose monitoring data on glycemia throughout labor and post-delivery will be retrospectively assessed."

            "Although multidisciplinary treatment of pediatric obesity has shown its effectiveness in leading to weight loss and improvement in the physical, mental and social health of children and adolescents; maintaining these benefits remains a real challenge. Indeed, the literature clearly shows a short- to medium-term increase in weight, the mechanisms of which have yet to be identified in order to prevent it. Although cognitive, behavioral and nutritional adaptations have been highlighted to explain this weight regain, metabolic and energetic adaptations also seem to contribute. Indeed, a reduction in resting and total energy expenditure has been shown (in connection with changes in body composition and in particular lean mass), but also of the energy cost during locomotion and mobility, thus altering the daily energy balance. These energy adaptations are also accompanied by a modification in the use of energy substrates due to a modification of muscular metabolic flexibility in particular, leading to a reduction in lipid oxidation in favor of carbohydrates. Importantly, if this reduction in the use of lipids generates a counterproductive sparing of adipose tissue, thus slowing down weight loss, the increase in carbohydrate oxidation leads to an intensification of orexigenic signals at the central level, promoting nutritional compensations and positive energy balance and therefore contributing to weight regain.\n\nThus, these adaptations of energy metabolism and their interactions with dietary control seem to be at the heart of the mechanisms limiting the success of obesity treatment, favoring weight gain. If these observations were made at the end of treatment programs lasting several weeks to months, a recent clinical work highlights the need to consider the kinetics and temporality of weight loss (weight loss variability and rate of weight loss), so as to identify the crucial stages where these adaptations take place and thus prevent their energy consequences.\n\nThus, the main objective of this project is to study total energy adaptations (energy and nutritional metabolism) at rest but also during locomotion, during the central phase of weight loss of adolescents with obesity, as well as during phases of weight regain. Ultimately, the objective of this study is to better understand energetic adaptations to weight loss and the implication of the degree of weight loss in order to study the role of the interaction between these adaptations and the degree of weight loss on the success of programs and on the profiles of \"weight maintainers\" or \"weight regainers\"."

            "Long-term pain affects one-third of the United Kingdom population and can be very disabling. People experiencing long-term pain often suffer from disturbed sleep because of their pain symptoms, and disturbed sleep can then make their pain symptoms worse. Managing long-term pain is also very costly to the National Health Service. The most common treatment is prescribed medicines, but these do not always work and can have serious side-effects for some patients.\n\nThe investigators have been developing an alternative approach for treating long-term pain. This approach uses simple non-invasive tools to promote some kinds of brain activity over others. It involves patients using headphones to listen to some specific sounds, or a headset with lights flashing at particular frequencies. The studies undertaken so far seem to show that doing this can change how the brain responds to pain. It potentially offers an inexpensive yet effective way of reducing pain and improving sleep for patients with long-term pain. There are a few small studies that support this approach and more work is needed. In a recent study the investigators found that these tools can be reliably used in home settings and there were some indications that they improved symptoms. However, sleep was only measured with sleep diary and movement detection, there was no direct measurement of whether the stimulation frequencies were resulting in the desired brainwave changes. Finally, the benefit to symptoms may have been the result of other factors, such as the passage of time or placebo effect.\n\nTherefore this study extends the experiment, adding more accurate sleep monitoring which includes monitoring electrical activity in the brain (EEG), as well as providing rhythmic and non-rhythmic stimulation in a randomised order. The aim is to further test the effect of these home-based tools with individuals with long-term pain, in a more rigorous way. Up to 30 participants with long-term pain and pain-related sleep disturbance will use the tools for 30 minutes at bed time every day for 4 weeks (2 weeks with one type of stimulation, 2 weeks with another type). The changes in participants' pain, sleep, brainwave frequencies, fatigue and mood will be measured.\n\nThese findings will inform the planning and design of a future much larger study to test this technology, if this is justified by the results."

            "Despite recent advances in acute stroke intervention, secondary prevention strategies are lacking. Physical activity (PA) is the second largest predictor of stroke and the cornerstone of secondary prevention therapies. Adaptive interventions involve sequential treatments responsive to individuals' performance. Despite guidelines to adapt PA to individuals' needs, there is no evidence on the empirical development of adaptive PA interventions post-stroke. The evidence is dominated by standard trial designs, used to evaluate non-adaptive PA interventions. This trial will make original contributions to the literature by designing a first-in-class adaptive PA intervention using an innovative experimental design. This design will permit the delivery of optimal sequences of treatments to increase PA for individuals. Furthermore, by developing a user-informed smartphone application, this feasibility trial will lead to the design and evaluation of a highly-scalable definitive intervention to reduce the risk of recurrent stroke.\n\nAim To use a Sequential Multiple-Assignment Randomised Trial (SMART) design to develop an adaptive, user-informed mobile health (mHealth) intervention to improve PA post-stroke. Subsequently this adaptive intervention will be evaluated against a treatment-as-usual control using a standard trial design in a definitive trial.\n\nMethods A co-design process was used to develop the technology platform for intervention delivery. There are two components which target increased PA in the current intervention: Structured Exercise and Lifestyle PA. The SMART will determine what sequence and/or combination of these intervention components produces the greatest increase in physical activity as measured by average daily step count. The primary outcome will be PA (steps/day), with clear feasibility and secondary clinical and cost outcomes. A SMART design will be used to evaluate the optimum adaptive PA intervention among people post-mild-to-moderate stroke."

Furthermore, exercise training (i.e., exercise performed over a number of sessions) can result in reduced pain sensitivity (increased pressure pain threshold). However, the optimal exercise prescription required to achieve pain sensitivity reduction is currently unclear. The next step is to determine experimentally whether increasing physical fitness will lead to positive effects on central pain processing (i.e., pain sensitivity, pain modulation, spinal nociception). The aim of this study is to examine the effects of two exercise programs on central pain processing in healthy sedentary individuals. In case of positive effects, this would provide a rationale for the future to investigate this in chronic pain patients with impaired pain modulation."

            "Knee osteoarthritis (KOA) is the leading and fastest increasing cause of disability in older adults. It is a serious health issue related with a high health care utilisation. The first-line KOA management is nonsurgical care, with education and exercise therapy as key elements. Nevertheless, treatment effects of exercise therapy and behavioral pain management on improvements in pain, function and quality of life are small to moderate at best. This shows that there is an urgent need for better KOA care. The innovative solution may lie in thinking beyond joints, by targeting KOA subgroups through comorbidity-specific interventions, which fits well in the global move towards precision medicine. With a prevalence rate up to 50%, the presence of insomnia symptoms is a highly prevalent KOA comorbidity, contributing to symptom severity. If left untreated, it represents a barrier for effective conservative management. Since insomnia is nowadays hardly addressed in the often joint-targeted KOA care, the scientific objectives of the study are to assess 1) if cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) integrated in best-evidence usual care, consisting of education and exercise therapy, (CBTi-UC) is more effective than best-evidence usual care alone (UC), i.e. education and exercise therapy, at 6 months follow-up in improving clinical outcomes and 2) if CBTi-UC is more cost-effective than UC in KOA patients with comorbid insomnia."

Interventions to promote physical activity and sleep that use commercial activity trackers may be useful non-pharmacological approaches to managing individual health; however, limited evidence exists on their use to improve physical activity in elderly patients with multimorbidity. This study aims to measure the effects of behavioral change techniques (BCTs) delivered by a wearable device on physical activity (PA) and quality of sleep (QS) in elderly patients with multimorbidity. The investigators designed an open-label randomized controlled trial with participants recruited through primary care and a specialist outpatient clinic. Participants must be more than 65 years old, have multimorbidity, and have access to smartphones. All eligible participants will receive PA promotion content and will be randomly assigned to wear a smartwatch. The primary outcome will be the participants' PA measurement at six months using the IPAQ-SF. Secondary outcomes will include changes in the participants' frailty status, biometric measurements, quality of life, and biopsychosocial assessments. A sample size of 40 participants per arm was calculated to detect group differences, with 50 participants recruited and randomized into each arm. This study aims to contribute to a better understanding of PA patterns and the impact of smartwatch-based PA interventions in patients with multimorbidity. The trial's findings are expected to improve our understanding of how physical activity patterns, patient-reported outcomes (PROMs), and healthcare resource utilization are linked in patients with multiple medical conditions.

Different professional societies, including the German Society of Pneumology and the European Respiratory Society, recommend rehabilitation intervention to reduce the sequelae of COVID-19. However, from the perspective of science and practice, there are relevant areas that have been insufficiently investigated and are essential for the treatment success of post/long COVID patients:\n\n* Differentiation of rehabilitation effects from natural recovery after COVID-19.\n* Lack of personalized and symptom-based treatment approaches that can address the heterogeneity of symptoms in post/long COVID\n* Lack of uniform, high-quality rehabilitation standards in post-/long-COVID.\n\nTherefore, post-COVID patients will be recruited at several post-COVID practices around Germany and randomized to receive (A) a rehabilitation program or (B) usual care. The primary objective of this randomized controlled trial (RCT) is to investigate whether a 3-week symptom-oriented, inpatient, multidisciplinary rehabilitation intervention, whose content focus is standardized according to cluster assignment (fatigue, cognition, soma), has a positive effect on the quality of life (primary outcome) in post-COVID syndrome patients compared to a usual care group (standard outpatient care). All study participants will be provided with a continuous telemonitoring system (SaniQ app) throughout the study period.

After registration, users were instructed to (a) enable step count tracking and (b) 'carry their phone' as much as possible over a five-day baseline period. Days with step counts between 1,000 and 40,000 were considered 'valid days'. Users first personalized daily step goal was calculated using the median step count of the five-day baseline. A goal was given once five days of step data were collected; if the median was \\<2500 steps per day, the first goal was 2500 steps. Afterwards, step count goals were reassessed weekly and new step goals (past 30-day median) were introduced to the user on Sunday night (utilizing the \"fresh start\" effect). There was no increase on top of the median (e.g., +500 steps/day) to promote activity consistency and reduce the number of days with step counts lower than the 30-day median. After the baseline period, participants earned FIs in the form of 'points' ($0.10 USD per day) for reaching personalized daily step goals. Since people tend to overvalue points (\"numerosity\" concept), this is valuable to make smaller FIs more effective. Points could be redeemed for movie tickets and gym passes. Users could opt-in and participate in a weekly step goal challenge (i.e., complete 5/7 daily goals) for points ($0.25 USD). For the first 12 weeks, users could complete \\~2-4 health knowledge questionnaires or surveys per week, for points (\\~$0.25 USD per quiz); this served as an educational feature. After Week 12, health knowledge questionnaire frequency drops to once a week. Users could earn a maximum of $23.65 within the 12 weeks.

This study differs from previous studies in that both peer (Intervention-1) and nurse-led (Intervention-2)-led education programs are planned as interventions. This research was designed as a mixed method study to compare the effects of Peer and Nurse Led Health Protection and Promotion Training Programs Based on Social Cognitive Theory (SCT) on the health behaviors of older people. The research will be carried out in two stages. The first phase was planned as a parallel two-arm non-randomized experimental study. This phase is planned to be carried out between November 2024 and January 2025 in two separate elderly homes in Muratpasa district of Antalya province, where older people are concentrated. The sample size was calculated as 108 older people (Intervention-1: 54, Intervention-2: 54). Intervention will be implemented for 12 weeks with the Health Protection and Promotion Training Program Based on SCT under peer leadership in the Intervention-1 group, and the same interventions will be carried out in the Intervention-2 group under the leadership of a nurse. Primary results of the research; health protection and promotion behavior practice, health promotion behavior practice level, self-efficacy belief and health seeking behavior. Secondary measurement results are; It is an assessment of blood pressure, blood sugar, body mass index and cardiovascular disease risk. Results will be measured before and 12 weeks after the intervention with the Health Protection and Promotion Behavior Checklist, Elderly Health Promotion Scale, General Self-Efficacy Scale, and Health Seeking Behavior Scale. In the second stage, it was planned to conduct two qualitative phenomenological design studies. In the first qualitative study, the investigators aimed to deeply understand the views of older people who received peer leader intervention and nurse intervention; In the second qualitative study, it was aimed to understand in depth the experiences of the older people as peer leaders in the health protection and promotion training program based on SCT.

            "Patients with cancer in developing countries face considerable challenges in obtaining access to care due to a lack of human resources and infrastructure. This is particularly pressing for vulnerable populations such as older adults. In this setting, many patients receiving chemotherapy are unable to report the presence of toxicities, and adverse events can go unnoticed for considerable amounts of time. The goal of this study is to assess the accuracy of an objective patient-centered measure of physical function (the number of steps taken per day measured using an accelerometer-equipped smartphone) for the remote detection of chemotherapy toxicity in older adults. This study builds on a pilot trial showing that monitoring older patients remotely utilizing an accelerometer-equipped smartphone is feasible and acceptable, and that a decline in the number of steps detected using the device can be an early sign of chemotherapy toxicity. The hypothesis of this study is that a decline in the number daily steps from a prechemotherapy baseline, measured using an accelerometer-equipped smartphone, will be accurate for detecting chemotherapy toxicity in older adults with cancer. This study will evaluate the ability of a patient-centered measure (a decline in the number of daily steps compared with a pre-chemotherapy baseline) to identify the presence of clinically-significant chemotherapy-related toxicity in Mexican older adults with cancer starting first line chemotherapy. Patients will be provided with an accelerometer-equipped smartphone with an installed pedometer application. Baseline steps per day will be obtained and recorded before starting chemotherapy. The patients' steps will be monitored daily for the first three chemotherapy cycles and compared with baseline recordings. Patients will be contacted daily and chemotherapy toxicity will be assessed by a physician. If significant toxicities are identified, the patient will be prompted to seek medical attention. The optimal cutoff point for detecting chemotherapy toxicity utilizing a decline in the number of daily steps will be chosen and validated. The adherence and satisfaction with the intervention will also be evaluated. This study could improve current methods and transform the way in which cancer care is delivered by demonstrating that a simple patient-centered measure obtained using a commercially available smartphone can aid in the accurate identification of clinically significant toxicities among a vulnerable population such as older adults with cancer."

After registration, users were instructed to (a) enable step count tracking and (b) 'carry their phone' as much as possible over a five-day baseline period. Days with step counts between 1,000 and 40,000 were considered 'valid days'. Users first personalized daily step goal was calculated using the median step count of the five-day baseline. A goal was given once five days of step data were collected; if the median was \\<2500 steps per day, the first goal was 2500 steps. Afterwards, step count goals were reassessed weekly and new step goals (past 30-day median) were introduced to the user on Sunday night (utilizing the \"fresh start\" effect). There was no increase on top of the median (e.g., +500 steps/day) to promote activity consistency and reduce the number of days with step counts lower than the 30-day median. After the baseline period, participants earned FIs in the form of 'points' ($0.10 USD per day) for reaching personalized daily step goals. Since people tend to overvalue points (\"numerosity\" concept), this is valuable to make smaller FIs more effective. Points could be redeemed for movie tickets and gym passes. Users could opt-in and participate in a weekly step goal challenge (i.e., complete 5/7 daily goals) for points ($0.25 USD). For the first 12 weeks, users could complete \\~2-4 health knowledge questionnaires or surveys per week, for points (\\~$0.25 USD per quiz); this served as an educational feature. After Week 12, health knowledge questionnaire frequency drops to once a week. Users could earn a maximum of $23.65 within the 12 weeks. The health knowledge questionnaires primarily covered healthy eating and meeting PA guidelines (in line with the National Health Service (NHS), \"Live Well\" guidelines)."

Compared to other racial/ethnic groups, AIANs have 6 times higher rates of developing smoking-related cancers, including lung cancer. Commercial cigarette smoking accounts for half of all deaths among AIANs nationwide. AIANs' often lack of access to smoking cessation interventions, which may be due to inequities in the healthcare system, lack of health insurance, living in rural areas, systemic racism, and historical trauma. There is also a lack of effective smoking cessation interventions for AIANs. Smartphone apps have the potential to deliver a low-cost smoking cessation intervention with wide reach to AIANs. Apps require no in-person delivery and no provider training, do not require integration into complex hospital systems, can be freely accessed on an app store, and are available at any time and any place. iCanQuit is a behavioral intervention designed to help adults stop smoking by teaching skills for coping with smoking urges, staying motivated, and preventing relapse.

            "The ability to successfully integrate information across sensory systems is a vital aspect of functioning in the real world. To date, only a few studies have investigated the clinical translational value of multisensory integration processes. Previous work has linked the magnitude of visual-somatosensory integration (measured behaviorally using simple reaction time tasks) to important cognitive (attention) and motor (balance, gait, and falls) outcomes in healthy older adults. While multisensory integration effects have been measured across a wide array of populations using various sensory combinations and different neuroscience approaches, a gold standard for quantifying multisensory integration has been lacking. The investigator recently developed a step-by-step protocol for administering and calculating multisensory integration effects in an effort to facilitate innovative and novel translational research across diverse clinical populations and age-ranges. However, patients with severe medical conditions and/or mobility limitations often experience difficulty traveling to research facilities or joining time-demanding research protocols. Using the aforementioned protocol, the study team invented a mobile multisensory falls-assessment iPhone app called CatchU to facilitate physician discussion and counseling of falls in older adults during clinical visits (e.g., annual wellness visits with a subsequent telehealth call), in an attempt to alleviate disability, promote independence, and increase quality of life for older adults. The investigator team has provided a cross-sectional research proposal for a pilot study of 300 patients (over a 24-month period) in order to demonstrate acceptable-to-excellent predicative accuracy of CatchU for identifying older adults at-risk for falls."

Although neck pain can be attributed to traumatic or inflammatory disorders, the majority of neck pain has no discernible cause and is considered idiopathic. Neck pain that lasts longer than 3 months takes the form of chronic neck pain. Some problems such as changes in muscle behavior and decrease in proprioceptive sensory input are observed in individuals with chronic neck pain. The presence of such problems, especially the dysfunction of the deep cervical muscles and the inability of the proprioceptors to provide motor control, cause the position sense to be impaired in these individuals and the awareness of the neck of the individuals decreases.\n\nThe Left Right Judgment Task (LRJT) is a form of implicit motor imagery that involves determining as accurately and quickly as possible whether an image of a body part belongs to the left or right side. LRJT performance differences have been hypothesized to reflect changes in central nervous system functioning, errors in judgment, and changes in bodily representations. It has been shown that LRJT is a complex mental task that includes cognitive, sensory, motor and behavioral processes and can be associated with them.\n\nRecent studies have revealed that neck pain causes proprioceptive disorder and that proprioceptive training should be done in these individuals. A study showed that there is a strong correlation between biasedness judgment accuracy and proprioception.\n\nIn this context, the investigators aimed to investigate the knowledge about the effect of individuals with neck pain on proprioception, cortical body diagram and pain."

A laser used for the micro-sampling of material in vivo,\n2. A transport transfer line of the ablated particles,\n3. A mass spectrometer that analyzes them in real time and generates the molecular profiles of the epidermis,\n4. A data analysis procedure.\n\nThe SpiderMass(TM) is of great interest for the study of the skin because it allows non-invasive vivo characterization, and therefore without biopsy or sample preparation. In addition, it will complement techniques already used in the research center such as FTIR spectroscopy. Indeed, in acne studies the FTIR allows to obtain only the Fatty Acid Triglycerid ratio while the SpiderMass permits to detail these lipid classes by each observed molecule on the surface of the skin and follow their evolution."

Smartphone apps that deliver alcohol interventions may improve drinking outcomes and ensure Veterans can receive both treatments in primary care. This study will determine whether medications and an app for alcohol use problems offered to Veterans in primary care results in improved drinking outcomes, compared to Veterans receiving medications only. Study data will inform how to spread the app across the VA nationally."

One of the complications of a lateral ankle sprain is the development of chronic ankle instability (CAI). Conservative treatment is the initial therapeutic option for patients with CAI, however, the best strategies are not yet clear. Clinically, a new invasive technique has appeared, known as echoguided Percutaneous Neuromodulation (EPNM). To date there are no studies showing the efficacy of the technique in patients with CAI together with the combination of a neuromuscular exercise program.\n\nParticipants: Volunteers and adults, from the group of students of the Gimbernat University School with a history of ankle sprain and physically active who meet the inclusion criteria.\n\nStudy variables: Self-administered ankle function scales (Cumberland ankle instability tool: CAIT and foot and ankle ability:FAAM measure Scale), objective measurement of function in the lower limb (Test countermovement jump: CMJ and Side hop Test:SHT), measurement of isometric strength of the ankle musculature, measurement of dynamic balance (Test star excursion balance), range of motion measurement (Ankle Dorsiflexion) and pain measurement (Numeric pain rating scale: NPRS Scale).\n\nProcedures: After carrying out the assessment, the participants will be randomized to participate in a neuromuscular exercise intervention (control group) or in a neuromuscular exercise intervention together with an application of EPNM in the common peroneal nerve (control group). experimental). The duration of the intervention in both cases will be 4 weeks, where in the control group there will be 2 sessions per week of exercise and in the experimental group 2 sessions per week of exercise plus an application of EPNM.\n\nObjective and hypothesis: The main objective of the study will be to compare the short- and medium-term effects of both interventions in relation to the study variables to be measured. The investigators hypothesize that those patients who receive neuromodulation combined with the neuromuscular exercise program will have greater improvements."

            "New challenges, stressors, and a loss of support often accompany the transition from adolescence to adulthood. Not surprisingly, transitional-aged youth (TAY) between the ages of 18-25 experience some of the highest rates of mental distress. However, access to mental health services diminish for TAY due to gaps in care when transitioning from pediatric to adult services. These challenges are exacerbated in rural communities, such as in Northwestern Ontario, where youth already access mental health services less frequently and face longer wait times than those in more urban areas. Limited access and extended waits can exacerbate symptoms, prolong distress, and increase the risk for adverse outcomes. Novel, innovative approaches are urgently needed to support TAY in Northwestern Ontario. In partnership with St. Joseph Care Group and Thunder Bay Counselling Centre, the investigators are evaluating the impact of a mental health app (JoyPop) as a tool for TAY waiting for mental health services. The JoyPop app was developed to support improved emotion regulation - a fundamental difficulty for youth presenting with mental health challenges. A two-arm randomized controlled trial (RCT) will be used to evaluate the effectiveness of the app compared to usual practice while TAY are waiting for mental health services."

Benefits of a behavior change, becoming physically active and pursuing a healthy lifestyle will be explained by a trained physiotherapist who will also coach the patient during the PA program. The biweekly physiotherapy coaching starts at baseline and will follow a structured sequence of strategies to change patients PA behavior which will contribute to the adoption of leisure-time PA in patients daily living, so the program will be optimally tailored to the patients capabilities and preferences.\n\nThe primary endpoint is to examine the effectiveness of the RunKeeper use with additional physiotherapy coaching in improving patients' leisure-time PA compared with usual care in cancer patients as measured by the PASE subscale leisure-time Sum Score at baseline, 6, 12 and 26 weeks."

Hearing aids can help in these situations, but difficulties often remain in more challenging situations, for example, when a conversation is being held in a group or when background noise is present. These difficulties are often not only related to the hearing loss but also to how these sounds are processed in the brain. Auditory rehabilitation is believed to help persons with a hearing impairment train their listening and communication skills. Auditory rehabilitation includes sensory management to enhance auditory function; knowledge and skills to improve the outcome; perceptual training and counselling. For this reason, the ALICE app was developed. The ALICE app contains monitoring tests, listening training exercises and counselling for persons with a hearing impairment.\n\nIn the current study, the ALICE app will be evaluated by persons with a hearing impairment.

With advances and proliferation of mobile technology platforms, there is substantial interest in the possible use of mobile health (mHealth) interventions to address these challenges. Of the mHealth approaches under investigation for TB adherence monitoring, drug metabolite testing has been identified as the most promising, ethical, and accurate, and the least intrusive and stigmatizing strategy compared to other mobile solutions, yet its potential remains largely unexplored. Additionally, mobile applications (apps) may provide personalized treatment supervision, increase patients' self-management and improve patient-provider communication by offering more advanced functionalities for patient support and monitoring.\n\nThe existing version of the TB-TST app offers education on TB and its treatment, communication with a care-coordinator, tracks treatment adherence (both by self-reporting and direct metabolite test strip images), self-reports treatment side-effects, and retains patient's \"diary\" notes. This proposal builds on preliminary work to: 1) Refine the TB-TST intervention based on pilot study findings and apply principles of user-centered design; 2) Evaluate the impact of the TB-TST on treatment outcomes compared to usual care; 3) Assess patient and provider perceptions of the facilitators and barriers to implementation of the TB-TST and synthesize lessons learned with stakeholders and policy makers. Primary outcome will be treatment success. Secondary outcomes will include: treatment default rates, self-reported adherence, technology use and usability. Findings have broader implications not only for TB adherence but disease management more generally and will improve our understanding of how to support patients facing challenging treatment regimens"

The objective is to determine if laterality recognition accuracy deficits are present in individuals with bilateral chronic knee pain and if DN affects 'central' and 'peripheral' musculoskeletal measurements. Chronic musculoskeletal pain results in changes to the way the brain perceives pain and left-right discrimination between body parts. This phenomenon has been established for individuals with chronic back pain and chronic regional pain syndrome, but has not been described for individuals with bilateral knee pain without the presence of knee OA. Dry needling involves the insertion of a small diameter monofilament needle into muscle, and has been purported to affect the neuromuscular system both centrally and peripherally. Sixty individuals between 18 and 40 years old will be recruited and allocated into three groups. The first group will consist of 20 subjects presenting with bilateral chronic anterior knee pain and high fear of movement with scores on Tampa Kinesiophobia Scale (fear of movement) greater than 37.

One of the most common cardiologic diseases at the age of 18-30 is benign heart rhythm disorder, which often does not require diagnosis or treatment and can be considered normal.\n\nThat said, notification of the detection of atrial fibrillation can affect psycho-emotional well-being, particularly anxiety.\n\nThis study will assess the level of psycho-emotional health (anxiety level) of the study participants. Participant observation will provide an opportunity to identify associations between the use of the ECG recording function on wearable devices and levels of anxiety and depression. It is hypothesized that the use of smartwatches with the ECG function activated will not lead to a change in anxiety levels on the GAD-7 scale among the study participants.

            "The proposed studies will test this hypothesis by randomizing patients with AF to 2-HOBA or placebo 7 days prior to AF ablation to allow 2-HOBA to reach steady-state levels. We hypothesize that tissue injury from AF ablation causes a large release of ROS that react with lipids to generate IsoLGs (Figure 2). In the absence of 2-HOBA, IsoLGs will react within seconds to form IsoLG-macromolecule adducts in atrial tissue, promoting early recurrence of AF. In the presence of 2-HOBA, IsoLGs will rapidly react to form IsoLG-macromolecule adducts in atrial tissue, promoting early recurrence of AF. In the presence of 2-HOBA, IsoLG will preferentially bind to and therefore be inactivated by 2-HOBA thereby sparing injury to the atrial tissue caused by oxidative stress and its contribution to early recurrence of AF. Early recurrence of AF will be measured by ECGs that are recorded once per day by a smartwatch (Apple Watch, Apple Inc., Cupertino, CA) with additional ECGs recorded by the participant if they experience symptoms of AF, or if the smartwatch alerts the participant of a possible AF episode via its auto-detection AF monitoring algorithm. The Apple Watch's AF algorithm is based on sampling of heart rate and variability and will give an audible alarm if those parameters indicate a possible episode of AF. The smartwatch records a single-lead ECG if the participant touches the watch with their contralateral hand. The day and time of the episode is also stored by the smartwatch. At the end of the 28-day follow-up period, study personnel will review the stored ECGs. Blood will be drawn prior to ablation and on post-procedure Day 1 for measurement of IsoLG-adduct levels. DNA will be extracted to explore a pharmacogenomic interaction with haplotypes at the chromosome 4q25 AF risk locus, which: 1) is strongly associated with the development of AF and the early recurrence of AF after ablation27; and 2) has been reported to be a regulator of an anti-oxidant gene program in response to cardiac injury."

            "Alopecia areata (AA) is an immunologically mediated disease characterized by non-scarring hair loss (Madni and Shapiro, 2000). AA is presented by rapid and complete hair loss in one or more round or oval patches, usually on the scalp, beard area, eyebrows, eyelashes, and less commonly, on other hairy areas of the body (Berker et al., 2010 and James et al., 2011) Alopecia areata is a T-cell-mediated autoimmune disease. There is a complicated interplay between loss of immune privilege in the hair follicle, autoimmune-mediated hair follicle damage, and activation of inflammatory pathways that have been argued to explain the development of this disorder, but the exact pathophysiology of AA remains unknown. Hair follicles are infiltrated by autoreactive CD8 and CD4 T lymphocytes, which attack hair follicle-derived autoantigens while sparing the stem compartment (Rajabi et al., 2018).\n\nAlopecia areata can be treated with topical and/or intralesional corticosteroids, which are the treatment of choice. Anthralin, minoxidil, coal tar, and topical immunotherapy are examples of other topical treatments. Systemic immunosuppressants such as cyclosporine, systemic steroids, Janus kinase inhibitors, and methotrexate may be considered in severe resistant cases (lee and lee, 2017).\n\nIntralesional triamcinolone acetonide is preferred in cases of AA , as it is well known as anti-inflammatory and interferes with local immunity of the skin, which helps in the recovery of the disease, but if used in wrong technique or given in a high dose, it might cause all the side effects of corticosteroid, especially skin atrophy (Berker et al., 2010).\n\nLactic acid is a member of alpha-hydroxy acids. It has been used in the treatment of many skin diseases, like AA and vitiligo. Lactic acid stimulates spontaneous secretion of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) by human reconstructed epidermis. VEGF is an angiogenic cytokine involved in angiogenesis and wound healing and stimulates the growth of hair follicles resulting in recovery of AA. Other studies suggest that lactic acid may act through its irritant effect (Al-Tammimy, 2005).\n\nVitamin D interacts with the innate and adaptive immune systems in a variety of ways, the majority of which contribute to its downregulation (Nancy and Yehuda, 2009). It has a powerful effect on T and B lymphocytes, influencing their activation responses (Arnson et al., 2007).\n\nAll cells of the immune system express 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 receptors (VDRs) and are therefore vulnerable to calcitriol-mediated modulation. Vitamin D3 has the ability to influence the migration and maturation of different dendritic cell subtypes and their production of chemokines and cytokines, giving them an immunoregulatory and tolerogenic role (Illescas-Montes et al., 2019) It has been shown that VDRs are highly expressed in the keratinocytes of human hair follicles and the absence of their expression is associated with reduced hair follicle growth and epidermal differentiation. Reduced VDR expression in the hair follicles of affected areas has also been observed in studies of AA patients' scalp (\u00c7erman et al., 2015).\n\nMicroneedling (MN) is a technique that comprises puncturing the skin repeatedly with sterile microneedles (Iriarte et al., 2017). It promotes hair regeneration by triggering stem cells in the hair bulge, which results in the generation of growth factors. It also improves blood circulation to the hair follicles and influences the local immune cells (Chandrashekar et al., 2014). Moreover, combining MN with applied topical drugs facilitates their absorption through the microchannels created within the epidermis (Fertig et al., 2018)."

            "A growing body of research implicates rumination as being a transdiagnostic risk factor involved in the development of depression and anxiety in youth. Critically, mindfulness meditation has shown significant promise in targeting rumination, and ultimately improving depressive and anxiety symptoms. Mindfulness apps offer a convenient and cost-effective means for accessing mindfulness training, while being interactive and engaging for youth. Despite their growing popularity among teens, strikingly little research has been conducted on these apps. Two critical questions have yet to be addressed: (1) what are the underlying neural and cognitive mechanisms that account for the beneficial effects of these apps and (2) for whom is app-based mindfulness well-suited. To address these gaps, adolescents (ages 13-18) will be randomly assigned to an app-delivered mindfulness course vs. a control condition and will complete pre- and post-intervention resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scans to probe static and dynamic functional connectivity within - and between - brain networks strongly implicated in mindfulness training and rumination. In addition, cognitive tasks will be administered at pre- and post-intervention to assess attentional control abilities putatively enhanced by mindfulness training. Finally, mindfulness skills and changes in rumination will be assessed via smartphone-based ecological momentary assessment (EMA). First, the investigators will test whether changes in (1) brain functional connectivity, (2) attentional control and (3) acquisition and use of mindfulness skills mediate between-group (i.e., app vs. control) differences in the reduction of rumination. Second, the investigators will test whether a machine learning model incorporating baseline clinical, demographic, and psychosocial characteristics can be used to identify which adolescents are predicted to benefit from app-based mindfulness training."

            "Reducing Opioid Use and Misuse After Wisdom Molar Extractions",
            "Reducing opioid prescription related use and misuse is a major focus for countering the national epidemic of opioid overdose and death. Annually, over 3.5 million predominantly young and healthy individuals undergo outpatient third molar ('wisdom tooth') tooth extractions under sedation and routinely receive postoperative opioid prescriptions. This procedure is among the most prevalent instances of opioid prescriptions dispensed to adolescents, a vulnerable population. This overuse can be minimized by bringing about immediate and sustained pain relief following extractions and by proper monitoring to regulate post-operative opioid usage.\n\nThe investigators developed the Twin block, a local anesthetic nerve block that rapidly eases pain from the 'closer' muscles of the jaw and showed its long-term effectiveness in patients with chronic jaw muscle pain. Administering the Twin block immediately following third molar extractions will be an innovative and effective modality to alleviate acute post-procedure pain experienced by the patient and hence reduce the need for post-operative opioid pain medication.\n\nIn order to tightly regulate when, how many and to whom the prescribed opioid pill is accessible, this study will utilize the iPill Dispenser\u00ae, an active pill dispenser. The iPill device, designated as a Class I 510(k) exempt device by the FDA, includes an App that utilizes biometric user authentication to operate a portable tamper-resistant, pre-calibrated device to regulate, deliver, and monitor opioid usage for pain, preventing overconsumption and diversion. The investigators further plan to 'track' pill swallowing by encapsulating the medication with an ingestible event marker (IEMs, FDA approved Class II device). The hypothesis of this study is that reduction in opioid prescription and its unwarranted use following third molar extractions can be achieved by a combination of Twin block, an active pill dispenser and ingestion tracking. The Specific Aims are:\n\nSpecific Aim 1. Compare highest pain after third molar tooth extractions, in patients with and without the twin block.\n\nSpecific Aim 2. Compare postoperative opioid consumption during the first 4 days following third molar tooth extractions between patients who got the twin block, with those who do not. Using the iPill dispenser and app and the IEM, the investigators will track opioid consumption for severe pain."

            "Examining the Efficacy of a Digital Therapeutic to Prevent Suicidal Behaviors",
            "The primary aim of the project is to test the efficacy of BCBT delivered via a digital platform (i.e., smartphone) to Servicemembers with recent suicidal ideation and/or suicide attempts presenting to primary care clinics. Given existing challenges of scaling empirically-supported treatments/interventions for suicidality with fidelity, this project could lead to markedly expanded access to BCBT, along with improving our understanding about what intervention strategies are most effective and how they can be delivered with meaningful fidelity. Aviva, the digital version of BCBT, was developed for use with patients across the full spectrum of healthcare settings, including primary care. Aviva is not an emergency alert system, rather a digital platform for delivery of the full scope of BCBT treatment components. An open-label single group Phase I clinical trial has demonstrated the safety, tolerability, feasibility, fidelity, and potential efficacy of Aviva, with participants completing modules over 8 weeks, and follow-up assessments at weeks 1, 4, and 8. Subsequent refinements included the addition of technical features that would allow patients to revisit and/or repeat previously completed modules, along with integration of more characters for delivering video vignettes and greater opportunities for skills practice and treatment engagement. These modifications have further enhanced Aviva safety, tolerability, and fidelity, consistent with the original BCBT protocol. Not only is it hypothesized that Aviva will result in significantly larger reductions in severity of suicidal ideation than participants randomized to the control condition, but also that greater app engagement will be negatively correlated with severity of suicidal thinking. Moderators and mediators (i.e. suicidal beliefs, wish to live, impulsive decision-making) of intervention effects will also be examined. The study will be conducted at the primary care clinics at Fort Carson, with a goal of enrolling 720 patients across a two-year timeframe. Participants will be identified using each clinic's existing suicide risk assessment methods, including the PHQ-9 suicide risk item and a score of 1 or higher on the CSSRS Screener (Recent). Participants will be randomly assigned to one of two treatment conditions, Aviva or control (i.e., development of a safety plan consistent with local procedures and policies, along with referral for standard mental health care and suicide risk management in accordance with local policies and procedures). In an effort to address potential performance bias specific to smartphone use, participants in the control condition will download the Suicide Safety Plan app to their smartphones. Those in the Aviva condition will also complete weekly check-ins with Project 2 research clinicians to review treatment adherence, identify and respond to any logistical/operational problems, and respond to any unexpected emergencies and/or participant safety concerns. Participants will have up to five data points: baseline, 3, 6, 9, and 12 months. All data available from all participants and all time points will be included in the analyses, consistent with the intent-to-treat principle. Across our two previous clinical trials and our in-progress RCT, attrition during the first 12 months postbaseline was \\&lt;30% and we anticipate similar rates in this trial."

The Tobacco Treatment Guidelines underscore the need to offer patients who use tobacco products brief interventions that include prescriptions for proven pharmacological smoking cessation aids and proactive connections to evidence-based behavioral support. The rapid expansion of smart phone capabilities enhances the potential for tobacco cessation apps to personalize behavior change guidance and to send contextually relevant tailored behavior change nudges based on readiness to quit and electronic heath record (EHR) data. Rich data from EHRs are now available to third-party apps from the Health app (iOS) via Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources standard Application Programming Interface (API).\n\nThis Phase I SBIR will explore the acceptability and effects of one such innovative health IT solution. Refresh is a highly individualized tobacco cessation HealthKit enabled app that will 1) implement a full range of best practices in tailored health behavior change communications based on readiness to change; 2) individualize behavior change guidance based on Health app data; and 3) concisely provide data and documentation of key actionable insights in the EHR on the patient's smoking status, app usage, and brief micro-message clinicians can deliver to reinforce and accelerate a patient's behavior change progress. This interoperability will provide value to both patients and clinicians; empower and support successful and lasting behavior change; and enable the implementation and evaluation of a best-in-class approach to tobacco and nicotine treatment.\n\nExtensive end user and stakeholder input will ensure refresh is designed for rapid dissemination. Patients of an integrated delivery system with an upcoming appointment (n=100) will be recruited to participate in a 30-day pilot test. Pilot participants will provide quantitative and qualitative data, and utilization and acceptability data will be examined. Pre-post comparisons of PROMIS measure for tobacco (psychosocial expectancies) will provide preliminary data on the effects of the program.

            "Hypertension (HTN) is the most important stroke and cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factor. Unfortunately, there is substantial under-treatment of HTN. Of the 86 million adults with prevalent HTN in the U.S., 40 million (46%) have inadequately controlled blood pressure (BP). This problem is worse among minority groups. In this study, the investigators demonstrate how mHealth (mobile health technology) can improve HTN control rates in stroke survivors and primary care patients without stroke, but who are at a high risk of stroke and CVD. Our intervention is called mGlide. Intervention participants will self- monitor their BP daily using a wireless BP monitor and a smart phone. The phone will transmit this BP to a database automatically. The investigators will use the framework of glide paths to manage the transmitted BP data. The glide path, based on the concept of landing an airplane, establishes an expected trajectory of BP readings for each patient with bounds set by guidelines and provider input. BP is monitored at home; the health care team is alerted when patient BP deviates from expected bounds. Alerts are generated once a week for the health care team with a list of patients with uncontrolled HTN. This facilitates early intervention while avoiding information overload. Partnering clinical centers include Federally Qualified Health Centers that serve low income and minority (Latino, African American, Hmong) communities. In this RCT study, the investigators will randomize 450 participants with uncontrolled HTN to the mGlide intervention (n=225) vs. state-of-clinical-care comparison (n=225)."

Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) has shown promise in bolstering mental health across diverse populations. Preliminary findings from a feasibility trial (NCT05803252) suggest the potential of FACT in this context.\n\nMethods: Expanding upon prior research, this definitive RCT compares FACT to standard parenting advice, correcting for earlier limitations through increased sample size and rigorous methodology. Assessments will be conducted at baseline, post-intervention (4-8 weeks), and 6-month follow-up.\n\nResults: The study anticipates that FACT will demonstrate superior outcomes in promoting well-being among parents compared to parenting advice alone.\n\nConclusion: By leveraging videoconferencing for therapy delivery, the RCT aims to improve access to mental health interventions and emphasize the importance of psychological health among parents of special needs children. This could foster greater recognition and proactive management of mental health within this population."

Clinical practice guidelines for chronic neck pain recommend conservative management. Conservative treatment includes many approaches such as endurance, stretching and strengthening exercises, manual therapy, proprioceptive exercises, pilates and yoga. In patients with chronic neck pain, atrophy of deep neck muscles, deterioration in fiber type ratio, muscle tenderness and decreased range of motion are observed. These problems cause poor cervical postural control system and thus impaired sense of proprioception, loss of balance, decreased eye movement and cervical muscle activity. Sensorimotor control of upright posture and head-eye movement relies on information from the vestibular, visual, and proprioceptive systems that assemble throughout the central nervous system.The cervical spine has an important role in providing proprioceptive input. This role is associated with an abundance of cervical mechanoreceptors. Recent studies have shown that proprioceptive training is associated with cervical joint position sense, joint range of motion, pain and disability. Also yoga combines physical exercises with breathing techniques and meditation and yoga is one of the most commonly used complementary treatments for neck pain.The aim of study is to determine the effectiveness of exercises for sensorimotor structure and yoga exercises with physical and meditative effects in individuals with chronic neck pain."

            "Childhood obesity within the United States has been a growing concern over the past number of years, and if not addressed, leads to detrimental health outcomes for youth as they move into adulthood. The literature suggests that over-eating, especially when framed in terms of food addiction, plays a key role in this epidemic; however, treatment options are time intensive, posing a profound logistical barrier for both the child and parent and often limits or prevents engagement. As research within the field of mHealth has grown, technology-based interventions have gained traction, specifically interactive smartphone applications (apps). Displacement theory, although not new, has been understudied yet provides a strong explanation and treatment plan for addictive type behaviors. The core of this theory posits that problems which one feels they cannot face nor avoid leads to repetitive and irrepressible behaviors; however, if a healthy coping behavior can be learned and utilized, then the unhealthy behavior will cease. The theory lends itself well to being adapted into an mHealth format, making it more easily accessible and more widely used. Grounded in displacement theory, the proposed study aims to develop an app-based weight loss intervention for adolescents with obesity. Information gained regarding the feasibility and acceptability of such an intervention can potentially be replicated and applied to other populations with various addictive behaviors. Helping those with addictive behaviors in a format that has little to no logistical barriers can have a substantial impact on public health. A novel smartphone app will be designed by key stakeholders and refined through the course of the study. 46 total adolescents (14-18 years old) with %BMIp95 will be recruited via various sources (e.g., clinic referrals, flyers, social media advertising) to participate in one of two stages of the study: the beta testing stage or the trial stage. Beta testing will enroll two successive groups of eight teens to test the app for three weeks; participants will be assessed in-person pre- and post-intervention. After each group, the app will be modified to incorporate their feedback in order to promote youth engagement. The trial stage will enroll 30 adolescents to participate in a four-month intervention; participants will complete three assessments, baseline, post-intervention (both in-person) and one-month post-intervention (either in-person or virtually). The study will examine engagement and satisfaction with the app, as well as the intervention's impact on clinical outcome measures (weight and BMI, diet and snacking, and addictive behaviors related to food and substance use) and potential mediators/moderators (motivation for change, perceived stress, and distress tolerance)."

            "PhaoeSOL (Microphyt, Baillargues, France) is a microalgae-based nutritional ingredient developed with a patented production process that has New Dietary Ingredient (NDI) status from the FDA (#1120). It is an extract of the microalgae Phaeodactylum tricornutum standardized to 2.0% Fucoxanthin (FX) content by adding a food grade medium-chain triglyceride (MCT)-oil and a tocopherol-rich (Vitamin E) extract (0.5 % w:w). PhaeoSOL is intended for use as a source of the naturally occurring carotenoid, fucoxanthin, in food supplement products for the general population at levels not to exceed 437 mg/person/day for a maximal duration of 30 days of PhaeoSOL (equivalent to 10 mg fucoxanthin/person/day). Prior studies suggest that marine algae and Fucoxanthinol may have anti-obesity, lipid lowering, and glucose management enhancing properties. The purpose of this proof of concept pilot study is to examine whether dietary supplementation of PhaoeSOL enhances the benefits of women participating in an exercise and weight management program."

Endogenous CS has an estimated incidence of 0.2 to 5.0 cases per million per year and prevalence of 39 to 79 cases per million in various populations. CS usually affects young women, with a median age at diagnosis of 41.4 with a female-to-male ratio of 3:1. Following a curative surgery for CS, patients develop adrenal insufficiency and require GC replacement postoperatively until the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis recovery occurs. Factors, such as age, gender, BMI, subtypes of CS, duration of symptoms, clinical and biochemical severity and postoperative GC dose have been reported to affect the HPA recovery in small retrospective studies. Glucocorticoid withdrawal syndrome (GWS) is a withdrawal reaction due to decrease in supraphysiological GC concentrations, which occurs after a successful surgery of CS. Glucocorticoid withdrawal syndrome (GWS) is under-recognized entity in patients undergoing curative surgery for endogenous Cushing syndrome.\n\nIn this study we aim to determine pre- and post-surgical predictors of the duration and severity of glucocorticoid withdrawal in patients undergoing a curative surgery for cortisol excess and assess the effect of MUSE intervention on GWS severity in patients undergoing curative surgery for CS as compared to standard of care."

The Transtheoretical Model(TTM) is an easy-to-use and proven model for changing sedentary life. Therefore, in the first stage of this two-stage research, it was aimed to develop the TTM-based 'Let's Move' mobile software program and to test the effect of the mobile software program developed in the second stage on changing the sedentary life behaviors of university students. The universe of this research will consist of 290 students studying at a foundation university in Istanbul. The sample was calculated using the G-power program (3.1.9.4) program. By taking 10% more of the sample, 97 students in the experimental group and 97 students in the control group will be randomly assigned through the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) program. The TTM-based mobile software program \"Let's Move\" mobile software program developed for the experimental group will be applied for 12 weeks. The effectiveness of the program will be evaluated with the pre-test, post-test and follow-up test, the International Physical Activity Questionnaire, the number of daily steps, the smart bracelet, and the TTM sedentary lifestyle TTM Sedentary Life Scales (Stages of Change, Self-Efficacy and Decision-Making scales). At the end of the research, the effectiveness of the 'Lets's Move' mobile software program \"Let's Move\" developed in this research in changing the sedentary life will be tested. In addition, it is aimed to increase the number of steps, decrease in sedentary behaviors and make an active lifestyle permanent.

Both intervention groups will also receive standard psychosocial therapeutic care, up to 8-10 sessions of supportive psychotherapy.Based on a power calculation a total of 546 participants, 273 in each arm will be included. They will be recruited from national suicide preventive clinics. Follow-ups will be conducted at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months after date of inclusion.\n\nParticipants, inclusion and exclusion criteria: There is no age restriction on participation in the study and all participants will be recruited from the suicide prevention clinics in Denmark. These clinics are highly specialized outpatient care centers, offering short-term supportive psychotherapy and social counselling for suicidal patients. In order to participate in the study, participants must have a smartphone (IPhone or android phone) and understand sufficient Danish to use MYPLAN.

Therefore, it is of great importance to develop and investigate the effectiveness of a low-cost app in reducing NSSI.\n\nThe purpose is to investigate whether treatment as usual (TAU) and the Zero Self-Harm app is superior to TAU in reducing 1) frequency of NSSI-episodes and 2) suicide ideation, and depressive symptoms in individuals with NSSI. As people with NSSI, without a comorbid psychiatric diagnosis, are not eligible to receive psychiatric treatment in Denmark, TAU includes many different treatments and counseling services, i.e. counseling at non-profit organizations, service centers in the municipalities, outpatient treatment services for psychiatric disorders, and care, information and attention at emergency departments. Common to them all is that they do not offer specialized treatment focused on NSSI.\n\nThe trial is designed as a 2-arm, parallel group, 6 months, randomized clinical superiority trial.

Plyometric training produces improvements in jump performance and lower body strength performance. A training program for young football players, using minimum equipment and effort, can result in improved player performance and a reduction in the risk of a possible overuse injury, reflected by an improvement in lower limb range of motion.

POAF can result in clinically significant morbidity and mortality. The national trend in the US is that the population older than 65 years is increasing, making healthcare expenditure related to POAF to be a major burden on health care system. Effective treatment of POAF is imperative in ensuring quality of care and reduction of costs.\n\nIn 2021 there is a projected total of 377,763 cardiovascular surgeries in the US alone with approximately half of which will have POAF with longer postoperative length of stay (+3.9 days) and higher discharge costs (+$13,993) than no-POAF patients (Reference: Ann Thorac Surg. 2015 Jan;99(1):109-14). Amiodarone, the currently used therapy, is often insufficient to prevent POAF and has multiple side-effects. In this study, we expect to improve the incidence of POAF by using a common acne drug (Minocycline) that is safe and that could be incorporated in clinical care of this disease."

            "Mental health disorders are one of the most challenging chronic conditions to identify, treat and manage. This is largely due to the fact that diagnoses are almost entirely based on the patient's recall of current and past subjective experiences of symptoms; and then further interpreted by a healthcare professional introducing multiple layers of information biases in the formulation of a diagnosis. Accordingly, mental health conditions remain prevalent with high rates of misdiagnosis, inappropriate treatment and delayed intervention. In light of the heterogeneity across and within mental health conditions, a personalized interventional approach holds merit, yet the tools to effectively track an individual's day to day objective and subjective experience needed to achieve an individualized care approach have not until recently existed.\n\nDigital technologies such as passive and active sensing from smartphones and from wearable devices are shedding light on the capabilities of tracking new objective measures of health that could translate to key symptoms of mental health conditions. 'Multimodal data' approaches are those that attempt to translate a variety of electrical signals from digital devices to relevant health outcomes. The combination of digital devices to detect multimodal measures of mental health symptoms offers a unique opportunity to take a ground up approach in understanding the fluidity of mental health symptoms occurring at the individual level that might lend insight into new phenotypes of mental health illnesses that could have a physiological underpinning.\n\nThe Study Investigators aim to characterize the multiplexing and fluid nature of mental health symptoms across individuals experiencing mental health symptoms and conditions using digital tools (i.e., wearables and mobile apps) and additional context information collected from virtual study support calls.\n\nThe Investigators hope to know how objective measures from sensor data translate to core symptoms, episodes and flares across mental health disorders, and develop new (or new applications of) machine learning anomaly detection approaches and determine whether anomalies in expected symptom portraits can be reliably detected and enhanced by the addition of objectively measured data."

Teenage depression has far-reaching consequences including impairments in academic and work performance and social and family relationships, substance abuse, and worsening of other health conditions, which can persist into adulthood. Access to mental health care for teenagers is limited due to a shortage of mental health providers and many teenagers and parents are reluctant to take antidepressants. COVID-19 and mandated physical and social distancing is expected to increase rates of teenage depression, and further limit access to traditional methods of care (e.g. psychotherapy). This highlights an urgent need to develop accessible, digital treatments for teenage depression to address the serious mental health impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. This fully virtual study (https://www.limbix.com/spark) will compare the relative safety, effectiveness, and engagement of a mobile application based on cognitive behavioral therapy and behavioral activation (Limbix Spark), focusing on the idea that engaging in behaviors that are rewarding or provide a sense of mastery can be effective in reducing symptoms of depression.

If untreated, the disease progresses from the mild and reversible form (i.e. gingivitis) that involves superficial gum only to the more severe and irreversible form (i.e. periodontitis) that involves loss of periodontal ligament and bone. Teeth will be lost eventually and significantly impairs the function and the oral health related quality of health. Moreover, periodontal disease has been strongly linked to the systemic diseases via centrally or local routes with significant health implications.\n\nPeriodontal disease is initiated by bacteria (plaque) adhere on tooth surfaces and the body defense by eliciting inflammatory response. The disease and associated inflammation is site-specific and the affected gum is manifested with the cardinal signs of inflammation such as redness (color), swelling (increased volume), edema (loss of surface characteristics) and bleeds easily. Dentists are trained to identify the disease sites by visual (redness and swelling) and by mechanical probing (bleeding). Traditionally these give rises to clinical gum indices showing the degree of inflammation and are important to the clinical monitoring and management of gum diseases.\n\nThe management of periodontal disease involves the removal of bacteria plaque by both dentists' tooth cleaning and maintained by patients' daily home-care. Home-care plaque removal has been shown by many studies to prevent and/or cease the development of periodontitis. However, most patients do not able to remove plaque effectively and it only takes few days for a health site to development inflammation. Professional monitoring and feedback are highly desirable but many patients only have monthly or even yearly appointment which is too late. Such \"non-compliance\" increase the treatment cost/time, patient discomfort and reduce treatment efficacy. Moreover, many patients do not receive regular dental checkup and they seek dentists when the gum problem becomes irreversible that complicated and expensive treatment such as tooth extraction and rehabilitation is required.\n\nThis study consists of 1) collecting the standardized clinical photography with clinical gum indices/ marked by an experienced clinician, 2) import into computer for training, and 3) longitudinally monitoring and analyze of gum condition in a group of gingivitis patients receiving gum treatment."

This design will test iKinnect2.0's new features for suicide prevention against TA youth awareness of and access to high-quality suicide prevention resources, while simultaneously testing features relating to conduct problems and parent management against parents knowing the TA youth's whereabouts in real-time and controlling for dyad member engagement in technology (Life360). Participants will be assessed at baseline, 4, 8 and 16 weeks. Primary youth-reported outcomes relating to suicide risk include: Suicidal behaviors (ideation, planning, attempts), non-suicidal self-injurious behaviors, self-efficacy in coping with distress, and use of imminent distress coping strategies (behavioral skills, use of crisis stabilization plan). Youth will also report on their criminal behavior. Primary caregiver-reported outcome variables relating to youth suicide include: Self-efficacy in applying family-based suicide-prevention strategies and reported use of those strategies; caregivers will also report on their own functioning (efficacy/confidence in parenting skills, life stress), TA youth functioning (internalizing and externalizing symptoms), parental management behaviors (expectation clarity, parental monitoring, discipline effectiveness/consistency, use of rewards), and parent-youth relationship quality (communication, conflict, support). App satisfaction and use of technology outcomes (i.e., degree of app usage, features used) will be examined and reported descriptively."

            "The purpose of this study is to investigate an immersive virtual field trip (iVFT) on topic specific academic vocabulary for students with developmental language disorder (DLD). DLD is the most common childhood learning disorder with a prevalence of 7.4%(1) and occurs in the absence of a known biomedical condition (e.g., hearing loss, autism, stroke, intellectual disability). DLD affects a person's academic and social function due to difficulty with using and understanding language.(2,3) Approximately half of students with DLD have a deficit in vocabulary that persists through highschool.(4) Once children fall behind in their language and vocabulary development, it is very difficult to catch up generally resulting in a wider gap as they progress through their school years. This deficit can have cascading social, mental health, occupational and financial consequences.(5) There is preliminary evidence that a virtual reality experience such as an immersive virtual field trip (iVFT) was beneficial for facilitating vocabulary and comprehension in general education(6-8) and within targeted populations of students including second language learners(9) and those with learning differences (e.g., autism,(10) attention deficit hyperactivity,(11,12) and dyslexia(13). The term \"immersive\" refers to a state of heightened sensation when viewing a simulated environment that is superimposed onto a screen with embedded multisensory input (e.g., visual, auditory, proprioceptive).(14) The viewer looks through 3D goggles to block out the present environment resulting in a feeling of presence. These simulated experiences or destinations (e.g., space) are a type of VR referred to as an immersive virtual field trip (iVFT).\n\nTo date, there is a lack of empirical evidence, explicitly targeting academic vocabulary growth for early grade school students with DLD. In addition, no study has reported on learning outcomes of students with DLD following a VR condition. Therefore, the primary study objective was to compare gains in academic vocabulary measures between a traditional book condition and an iVFT learning condition for young students with DLD."

Early treatment focuses on diet, exercise, lifestyle changes, treating risk factors (diabetes, hypertension, etc.) and administration of medications supporting kidney functions. However, once the glomerular filtration rate dropped below 15 ml/min/1.73m2, treatment with dialysis or a kidney transplant is required. Dialysis treatments come with a huge lifestyle management and economic burden to the patients as well as the healthcare systems.\n\nThe challenges may be facilitated by usage of mobile applications that help the patients/caregivers and multidisciplinary team to manage the complexity of Peritoneal Dialysis (PD) treatment. Even though several mobile applications currently exist, they focus on certain limited aspects of health monitoring like diet or vitals and medical adherence like medication reminders. An application which would take a comprehensive all-in-one solution approach targeted towards managing kidney health is needed. The platform developed by AWAK Technologies consists of a Admin Portal, web-based Clinic Portal and a Patient Mobile Application. The App would allow patients/caregivers to enter treatment data related to their dialysis therapy, medication, symptoms and vital monitoring. It also allows them to communicate with their healthcare team via messaging and teleconsult.\n\nThe study aims to evaluate the feasibility of using this mHealth platform in the clinical setting.

            "Low birth weight (LBW) infants are at significantly elevated risk for a host of detrimental outcomes including cognitive, language, and social delays and disabilities, which persist into adulthood. An important protective factor for mitigating risk is sensitive and responsive parenting. While evidence- based home visiting interventions exist and were developed specifically for LBW infants, such as the Play and Learning Strategies program, parents face major obstacles in accessing these interventions. In general, interventions demonstrated to be effective through federal research are very slow to migrate to community service delivery systems. Exacerbating this problem currently is the fact that while VLBW has been increasing, and disproportionately so for those who are poor an of minority status, home visiting programs have sustained some of the largest cuts in their histories. Consequently, there is high demand for effective interventions that can be delivered remotely. Through prior, the investigator team addressed this need by adapting the evidence-based PALS program for web-based delivery using laptop computers with streaming video of in-home parent child interactions and weekly remote coaching. The investigator team then rigorously tested its effects in a sample of low-income mothers and infants with typical birth histories. Results of this randomized controlled study showed pre-post growth in maternal sensitivity behaviors and significant increases in infants' social engagement with their mothers, with moderate to large effect sizes for the intervention group as compared to the control group. These encouraging results provide a strong empirical basis for the enhanced web-based delivery method of the PALS program. Although PALS was originally developed and tested with LBW infants, the web-based version, InfantNet, has not yet been tested with this population. Moreover, emergent trends show that young Latino and Black women most often access the Internet through smart phones, not laptops. Consequently, there is great demand for improving access to evidence-based interventions by making them available on mobile devices such as smart phones. Response: To address the need for more accessible evidence-based interventions, the investigator team will overlay the InfantNet program onto the iPhone and rigorously test its effects with 60 low- income mothers and their LBW infants through a 2-arm, 3 cohort, randomized-controlled design."

The use of VR interventions has been studied in a wide range of medical conditions, including anxiety, phobias, obesity, chronic pain, and eating disorders. VR based simulation in pediatrics has grown rapidly in recent years and is expected to continue to grow. VR technology has become increasingly affordable, flexible, and portable, enabling its use in a broad range of environments including the outpatient clinical setting. Additionally, children are believed to have an inclination toward games of \"pretend\" or alternate realities further indicating the potential of this technology. While immersed in a game, they often become deeply absorbed and able to ignore aversive stimuli. VR is an engaging intervention that may help to detract from pain and anxiety for children undergoing painful procedures. Heart rate has been used as a means to objectively quantify the physiologic response to pain and anxiety.\n\nThe purpose of the study is to conduct a randomized controlled study that assess the utility of Virtual Reality simulations compared to non immersive visual distraction in pediatric patients undergoing outpatient procedures including cast removal and surgical suture/pins removal. Primary outcomes will include changes in patient heart rate (an age-validated surrogate for pain and anxiety) and patient-reported changes in anxiety and pain.

The key goal of strength training, especially during rehabilitation, is to regain healthy musculoskeletal function. Yet, there remains a fundamental lack of understanding with regards to the relationship between subject-specific musculoskeletal biomechanics (i.e. multi-body dynamics function) and different types of strength training interventions because of limitations in assessing these parameters outside the research setting. Thus, clinicians, physiotherapists and coaches continue making training recommendations based on subjective and generalised guidelines, with ineffective or possibly harmful consequences for individual patients and athletes.\n\nGoal: This project aims to advance strength training guidelines and monitoring of training safety and efficiency by means of subject-specific anatomically-based modelling, biomechanical analysis of musculoskeletal function and mobile monitoring of training volume and muscular fatigue in the athletic and recreational setting.\n\nMethod: For validation purposes, the investigators will conduct an 8-week intervention study in healthy volunteers with three levels of strength training volume of the key muscle-tendon groups associated with knee joint stability and relate the changes in musculoskeletal and biomechanical parameters to the training-specific parameters and muscular fatigue from mobile monitoring through correlation analysis.\n\nRelevance: In Switzerland, more than 1.3 Mio people are members of a fitness center.

This can profoundly affect the ability of active duty (AD) women to advance in their career. The first 12 weeks postpartum are the time period during which the most significant weight loss occurs and is critical in achieving a healthy weight in the first year postpartum. Many factors contribute to effective weight loss in this period among which the most critical are diet, exercise, and sleep. Breast feeding and depression may also affect weight changes postpartum. Research has shown diet to likely be the most crucial of these factors.\n\nThe PADaWL study is designed as a randomized controlled trial to assess the effects of dietary intervention on weight and physical fitness versus routine postpartum care in the first year postpartum. Subjects will be primiparous AD women from any military service recruited in the obstetric clinic in the third trimester of pregnancy at Tripler Army Medical Center. Data will collected in an ambi-directional fashion with pre-pregnancy physical fitness data, demographic and pregnancy data collected at time of enrollment. Subjects will be randomized to receive intensive virtual sessions with a dietician vs routine postpartum care for the first 12 months postpartum. We will utilize a biometric device to monitor activity levels and sleep, web-based diaries to monitor breast feeding and diet, and validated questionnaires to evaluate depression as well as diet and sleep. Subjects will be monitored weekly for the first 12 weeks postpartum and will then be further evaluated at 6, 9 and 12 months postpartum.\n\nPrimary outcome is weight at 12weeks postpartum and whether subjects have achieved military standards. Secondary outcome will be weight at 12 months postpartum and whether subject has achieved weight and fitness standards. The study intends to collect large amounts of data, and we intend to analyze which factors may be contributing to weight retention postpartum.\n\nThis study should provide an accurate assessment of the effects of pregnancy on AD women. It should generate a clean and accurate dataset on which multiple follow-on studies can be performed and provide data for designing further intervention studies in postpartum women. The results of this study should also be able to assist in developing policy and guidance concerning AD women and pregnancy."

The major aim of the study is to explore the scientific rationale for targeted gut microbiota modulation in management of obesity and related metabolic diseases.We estimate the transfer of microbiota from RYGB donors is superior to the transfer of lean microbiota at inducing reduced adiposity and improving high blood glucose levels in obese recipients. Each is better than a sham procedure (autologous FMT), which itself can also induce considerable short-term effects."

            "Perinatal depression and anxiety (PDA) are the leading causes of maternal mortality in developed countries. Women with a history of depression have a 20 fold higher risk of PDA at subsequent pregnancies. The adverse outcomes extend beyond maternal well-being to long-term deficits in children and families. The gut-brain axis is a newly recognized key player in mental health disorders. Specifically, the microbial composition of the gut along with their metabolites are directly involved in disease onset and course. Recent clinical studies have identified diet as the most powerful environmental factor in manipulating gut microbiome. Given vulnerability and resistance of pregnant women to pharmacotherapy, particularly in those with a predisposition to mood disorders, as well as pregnant women's high motivation and commitment to improving gestational diet, a dietary/supplemental intervention to 'optimize' gut microbiome, is a favored approach in disease management. The study investigators aim to exploit microbial responsiveness to diet together with this maternal motivation, to alter the risk and severity of a universal public health concern that has dire and long-term consequences for new moms and their children.\n\nThe investigators of this trial, will first study the challenges in pursuing a study aimed at changing the microbiome of pregnant women with a history of mood disorders. Pregnant women in their second trimester will be recruited. Each will be assigned or randomized to one of four groups that will use a combination of diet, supplementation with probiotics, fish oil or no intervention. Each participant will meet with the study team virtually every 3 months until 1 year after delivery. At each study visit participants will be required to complete some questionnaires about their food intake, mood, and other health related measures and will provide a stool sample using the stool collection kits provided.\n\nThe findings from this study will help strategize for a larger study that will allow for comparison of the effects of diet, and/or supplementation with Omega-3 Fatty Acids (O3FA) and probiotics on the microbiome and the onset and severity of PDA."

            "Approximately 70% of American adults have overweight/obesity, which increases risk of major medical issues and preventable death (Abdelaal et. al, 2017). Many individuals with overweight/obesity attempt to lose weight through behavioral strategies, e.g., adopting a reduced-calorie diet and/or increased physical activity. However, it is exceedingly difficult to consistently adhere to a reduced-calorie diet and high levels of physical activity; as such, most individuals attempting to lose weight via these methods experience repeated instances of non-adherence, i.e., dietary and physical activity lapses. These lapses are a core driver of weight loss failure, undermining individuals' ability to achieve weight control (Forman et al, 2017). As such, it is important to understand what predicts these lapses, which in turn allows for better lapse prevention. The current study proposes to measure these risk factors in an ecologically valid manner, i.e., in the moment they occur and in the context of individuals' everyday lives, using advanced technology. Specifically, the current study will use ecological momentary assessments (EMA; brief, repeated surveys delivered in one's natural environment, typically via a smartphone) and sensor technology (e.g., Fitbit and sensors on smartphone devices) to measure momentary risk factors of dietary and physical activity lapse, as well as the lapses themselves. Findings from this research project will lay the groundwork for a sophisticated just-in-time adaptive intervention (JITAI), a tailored, personalized intervention that targets momentary risk factors (e.g., cravings) via in-the-moment support, thereby reducing lapse occurrence and improving adherence to behavioral weight control prescriptions."

In the Preparation Phase of this K23, the investigators developed 3 novel treatment components targeting sexual minority women's weight loss barriers (i.e., minority stress, low social support, and negative body image), the investigators piloted the program among sexual minority women of higher weight, and the investigators conducted individual qualitative interviews to elicit feedback on the intervention's acceptability, cultural relevance, usability, and feasibility, and this feedback was used to refine the program.\n\nIn the Optimization Phase of this K23 (the current phase), 88 women will receive 12 weeks of Rx Weight Loss and will be randomized to receive 0-3 tailored components in a full factorial design with 23 (8) distinct combinations of components. Novel components that increase mean weight loss (by \u22652%) or the proportion of women achieving clinically meaningful weight loss (by \u226510%) at 6 months will be retained in a finalized obesity treatment package that the investigators will evaluate in a future randomized controlled trial (RCT) (Evaluation Phase).

For students with pre-existing mental health diagnoses, the added pressures can exacerbate challenges. Although colleges and universities strive to provide mental health support to their students, the high demand for these services makes it difficult to provide scalable cost-effective solutions. To address these issues, the present study aims to compare the efficacy of three different treatments using a large cohort of 600 students transitioning to college. Interventions were selected based on their potential for generalizability and cost-effectiveness on college campuses. The randomized controlled trial will assign 150 participants to one of four arms: 1) group-based therapy, 2) physical activity program, 3) nature experiences group, or 4) self-monitoring condition as the control group. In addition, biometric data will be collected from all participants using a wearable device to develop algorithmic predictions of mental and physical health functioning. Once recruitment is complete, modeling strategies will be used to evaluate the outcomes and effectiveness of each intervention. The findings of this study will provide evidence as to the benefits of implementing scalable and proactive interventions using technology with the goal of improving well-being and success of new college students."

            "Ectopic fat is the accumulation of adipose tissue in anatomical sites not classically associated with fat storage - for example, in the liver and skeletal muscles. Excessive fat accumulation in liver cells, often diagnosed as non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), is a precursor to a wide range of liver conditions and metabolic disorders. The usual standard of care for NAFLD is to advise weight loss through controlled diet and physical activity, but the outcome of weight management and treatment of NAFLD is highly variable.\n\nDiet interventions - such as the Mediterranean, ketogenic, paleo, and high-protein-low-carbohydrate diets - have shown varied benefits in the management of NAFLD. However, food-based interventions must align with cultural and regional preferences in food to succeed in making the modifications part of the habitual diet. A recent diet intervention study (Della Pepa et al., 2020) highlighted that the components of a diet, rather than its caloric content, play a greater role in achieving healthier outcomes. In this study, a multifactorial diet intervention using locally sourced and produced meals will be implemented with the aim of reducing elevated liver fat content in healthy women diagnosed with NAFLD.\n\nThe study will also evaluate the effects of the proposed diet on the participants' metabolic health and describe potential changes in their gut microbiome signatures (via frequent stool samples). The dysregulation of the gut microbiota has been linked to the development of NAFLD and it is known that the composition of the gut microbiota could be modified by dietary intake. This study will investigate the association of gut microbiome signatures with elevated liver fat in Asian women and test whether the dietary intervention will modify their gut microbiota.\n\nFinally, ectopic fat in the liver is a highly prevalent condition worldwide but the cut-off values for NAFLD has been largely derived from studies performed in Western populations. This study seeks to cross examine the diagnostic ranges in various clinical assessments of NAFLD that commonly involve ultrasound spectroscopy (Fibroscan), fatty liver indexes (FLI) and magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS). This effort seeks to derive appropriate cut-off values for NAFLD in Singaporean-Chinese women."

This is largely due to the fact that diagnoses are almost entirely based on the patient's recall of current and past subjective experiences of symptoms; and then further interpreted by a healthcare professional introducing multiple layers of information biases in the formulation of a diagnosis. Accordingly, mental health conditions remain prevalent with high rates of misdiagnosis, inappropriate treatment and delayed intervention. In light of the heterogeneity across and within mental health conditions, a personalized interventional approach holds merit, yet the tools to effectively track an individual's day to day objective and subjective experience needed to achieve an individualized care approach have not until recently existed.\n\nDigital technologies such as passive and active sensing from smartphones and from wearable devices are shedding light on the capabilities of tracking new objective measures of health that could translate to key symptoms of mental health conditions. 'Multimodal data' approaches are those that attempt to translate a variety of electrical signals from digital devices to relevant health outcomes. The combination of digital devices to detect multimodal measures of mental health symptoms offers a unique opportunity to take a ground up approach in understanding the fluidity of mental health symptoms occurring at the individual level that might lend insight into new phenotypes of mental health illnesses that could have a physiological underpinning.\n\nThe Study Investigators aim to characterize the multiplexing and fluid nature of mental health symptoms across individuals experiencing mental health symptoms and conditions using digital tools (i.e., wearables and mobile apps) and additional context information collected from virtual study support calls.\n\nThe Investigators hope to know how objective measures from sensor data translate to core symptoms, episodes and flares across mental health disorders, and develop new (or new applications of) machine learning anomaly detection approaches and determine whether anomalies in expected symptom portraits can be reliably detected and enhanced by the addition of objectively measured data."

Stress and burnout are risk factors that account for 10-20% of health expenditure and threaten work longevity in the world's fastest growing economies. Traditional face-to-face sources of mental care such as counseling and psychotherapy are effective as a countermeasure to stress, but not always accessible or acceptable for those with busy lifestyles. Because of this, there is an urgent need for on-demand, scalable interventions to reduce stress and improve mental and physical well being. Technology-based solutions are increasingly being proposed to fill this need.\n\nMindFi is a smartphone app that uses mindfulness exercises to help users cope with work stress and increase productivity. Since 2017, it has been featured by Apple, BBC, and Bloomberg and is being used at corporates such as Bain, Bloomberg, Cigna, and Zendesk. MindFi users contribute behavioral and self-report data, which are then used to generate individual recommendations for relevant, evidence-based exercises. These include mental care techniques such as mindfulness meditation, therapeutic journaling, psychosocial support and educational wellbeing quizzes.\n\nIn this study, the investigators will recruit 200 participants in a randomized controlled design, with 100 receiving access to content of the MindFi app, and 100 receiving access to a version containing music tracks for relaxation. Each intervention will last 4 weeks. Participants will use these apps for a period of 5 weeks (for a minimum of 10 minutes per day). Pre- and post-intervention, the investigators will measure self-reported ratings on a number of psychological variables, and will track sleep quality objectively for a one-week period."

            "Spinal cord injury (SCI) has been shown to be associated with impairment to the autonomic nervous system in the form of reduced activity of a key nerve known as the vagus nerve. As the vagus nerve has an important role in regulating inflammation and is associated with depression, it may represent a key mechanism which contributes to chronic inflammation and depression following SCI.\n\nA technique known as transcutaneous auricular vagus nerve stimulation (taVNS) can stimulate the vagus nerve non-invasively through an electrode applied on the skin of the ear. This technique has been shown to effectively reduce inflammation and improve symptoms of depression in other populations without any serious adverse events. However, it has not been assessed in individuals with SCI.\n\nThe primary objective of this study is to assess the efficacy of taVNS therapy for the treatment of inflammation and depression. Autonomic function as assessed by measures of heart rate variability (HRV) will also be assessed to quantify changes in vagal tone. The study will be conducted over a 2-year period, with 44 individuals with SCI and depression participating. Participants will be randomly assigned to receive either active taVNS or a placebo (sham) treatment over a 30-day period.\n\nThe researchers will assess changes in depression symptoms, autonomic function (heart rate variability), and biomarkers related to inflammation at baseline and 30-days. Safety and adherence will also be evaluated to confirm the feasibility for long-term use.\n\nThis study aims to explore a novel and non-invasive treatment strategy for depression in individuals with spinal cord injury. If taVNS is found to be safe, effective, and feasible for SCI patients, it could offer a simple, cost-effective way to address chronic inflammation and depression in this population."

Compared to men, women have a higher cardiovascular risk due to hypertension, dyslipidaemia, diabetes mellitus, obesity, physical inactivity, and a sedentary lifestyle. Plus, they have additional sex-specific cardiovascular risk factors such as gestational hypertension/diabetes, preterm delivery, premature menopause, and polycystic ovary syndrome.\n\nCardiovascular rehabilitation (CR) is a Class I, level A, clinical practice guideline recommendation, multidisciplinary secondary prevention program that has been shown to reduce cardiovascular mortality, rehospitalization, and improve quality of life. Despite all established benefits, CR continues to be under referred to women compared to men, with lower enrolment rates and lower adherence to exercise sessions. The reasons for the underuse of CR by women and the main barriers have been widely studied. Thus, sex-specific implementation strategies have been developed to improve adherence, however, the efficacy claims of these interventions are equivocal, as some studies revealed no significative difference regarding adherence between different exercise delivery modes and mixed-sex programs, whereas others revealed greater preference towards women-only programs.\n\nFew randomized controlled trials (RCT) examined the efficacy of CR programs tailored to women in adherence, enrolment, functional capacity, physical activity, body composition, and quality of life. Importantly, to the investigators knowledge, no RCTs used counselling sessions, women-focused educational sessions, personalized follow-ups and supervised exercise sessions as adherence strategies in maintenance CR community programs.\n\nThe goal of this RCT is to test whether a women-focused maintenance CR community program increases adherence compared to a standard care. Thus, the investigators hypothesized that:\n\n\u2022 The women-focused group will have greater adherence to the CR community program (main outcome)\n\nParticipants will:\n\n* Be assessed at baseline, at 3-months and at 6-months\n* Enrol in a supervised community-based maintenance CR program\n* Receive individually prescribed exercise sessions (both groups), a tailored package consisting of individual counselling sessions and educational sessions (women-focused group)"

Although it severely affects their quality of life, stress intolerance remains a mystery. Hence, unravelling the mechanisms underlying stress intolerance is crucial to understand CWP pathophysiology and to develop novel treatments. Epigenetic mechanisms hold the potential to provide an answer as they have been found to be altered in patients with CWP at baseline, and in response to stress. However, research on epigenetic mechanisms in CWP is very scarce. Hence, this study aims to address this knowledge gap by assessing stress-induced epigenetic changes in patients with CWP and healthy controls aiming to unravel whether epigenetic mechanisms can help explain stress intolerance. The regulatory role of epigenetic mechanisms will be researched in relation to the activity of enzymes affected by the epigenetic mechanisms, neurophysiological measures, and stress-induced symptom changes in patients with CWP."

            "Exercising in a nature setting has been credited with benefits for health and well-being, more so than exercising indoors. Additionally, motoric performance in the same exercise (e.g., running speed, more strenuous physical activity) has been reported in some studies to be greater if practiced outdoors, in a nature setting. The explanation may be in the inherent variability of natural landscapes, the textures, elevations, obstacles and objects which are not found in standard built and indoor settings. Indoor settings are characterized by safe, organized, patterned textures and objects created for specific ends, which inhibit variability in physical and physiological behavior. Variability in the environment turns into variability in body systems, which benefits health, well-being, and skill acquisition.\n\nVariability in behavior depends also on the task. Running or walking is essentially a journey throughout the environment in which interaction with obstacles, puddles, and other runners is part of the variability of the activity. On the other hand, physical activity such as HICT is done in a small area, and is a scripted, prescribed activity (e.g., push-ups, sit-ups), which lowers the amount of variability in behavior. The aim of this trial is to test if a low variability activity shows differences in performance, wellbeing, and behavior measures according to the amount of variability in the environment.\n\nIn this trial the participants will engage in two high intensity circuit training (HICT) interventions - one in an indoor setting, and another in a nature setting. The HICT intervention includes 12 calisthenic exercises, and will be performed at a self-selected intensity by the participants. Each exercise will be performed during one minute, followed by 30 seconds of rest where the participants will be instructed what the next exercise will be. Before exercising, the participants put a heart rate monitor and two inertial measurement units (IMUs) on the right arm and leg, according to the correct usage guidelines, and rate their positive affect, arousal, and perceived exertion. Immediately after exercising, they rate the same measures again.\n\nResearch Hypotheses:\n\nGreater movement variability, heart rate variability, performance, wellbeing, and arousal during HICT in nature setting than indoor setting."

Trail running and road marathon are two running endurance disciplines which differed by variation of elevation and nature of the terrain. While marathon is essentially run on flat roads, trail races are realized on steep paths (mountain, desert...) with an important variation of elevation. Neuromuscular, biomechanical and physiological consequences are different depending on the discipline, especially with a greater eccentric contribution in trail running. In spite of this characteristic, trail runners take part in several races longer than 40 km per year, while road runners participate in one to two marathons per year."

            "Temporomandibular joint dysfunction (TMD) is a broad clinical picture involving the TMJ and its disc, masticatory musculature, ligament tissue, and autonomic nervous system (ANS). TMD symptoms include decrease or excessive increase in joint range of motion (ROM), clicking sound or crepitation in the joint, pain around the joint or muscle group, chewing and swallowing problems. Pain caused by MPS, trigger point, fatigue, limitation of ROM, and ANS dysfunction cause TMD. With the inclusion of habits such as clenching and bruxism, pain, spasm and disability develop in the chewing muscles. Exposure to repeated trauma and excessive use of chewing muscles may cause the formation of tight bands and trigger points, which are characterized by MPS. When the relationship between TMD and ANS was examined, it was observed that increased sympathetic activity and decreased parasympathetic activity were effective in the severity of TMD symptoms. Auricular vagus nerve stimulation is a peripheral, non-pharmacological and non-invasive neuromodulation technique that modifies signal processing in the CNS, activates reflex circuits, exploits brain plasticity for different therapeutic purposes, thereby affecting very different areas of the brain. Non-invasive or transcutaneous Vagus Nerve Stimulation delivery systems provide stimulation in the auricular branch of the vagus nerve in the outer ear, thus eliminating the need for surgical implantation. The aim of our study is to reveal the extent to which Auricular Vagus Nerve Stimulation, applied in addition to the conventional rehabilitation program, affects the results of the treatment by stimulating the parasympathetic nervous system in patients with Temporomandibular Joint Dysfunction caused by Myofascial Pain Syndrome."

            "Alzheimer's Disease (AD) and Alzheimer's Disease-Related Dementias (ADRD) not only exact a heavy toll on patients, they also impose an enormous emotional, physical, and financial burden on unpaid, often family, caregivers. The strain of providing care for a loved one diagnosed with AD, often across several years, is associated with elevated depression risk and poorer overall health. Emotion regulation skills represent an ideal target for psychological intervention to promote healthy coping in ADRD caregivers. The project seeks to use an experimental medicine approach to test the efficacy and biobehavioral mechanisms of a novel, relatively brief, targeted, scalable, smartphone-based cognitive emotion regulation intervention aimed at improving psychological outcomes (i.e., reducing perceived stress, caregiver burden, and depressive symptoms) in ADRD unpaid primary caregivers as well as examine potential benefits of the caregiver intervention on quality of life in care recipients. Cognitive reappraisal is the ability to modify the trajectory of an emotional response by thinking about and appraising emotional information in an alternative, more adaptive way. Reappraisal can be operationalized via two primary tactics: psychological distancing (i.e. appraising an emotional stimulus as an objective, impartial observer) and reinterpretation (i.e., imagining a better outcome than what initially seemed apparent). The project will investigate the efficacy and underlying biobehavioral mechanisms of a novel, one-week cognitive reappraisal intervention in this population, with follow-up assessments at 2 weeks, 4 weeks, and 3 months. ADRD unpaid primary caregivers will be randomly assigned to receive training in either distancing, reinterpretation, or a no regulation natural history control condition, with ecological momentary assessments of self-reported positive and negative affect, remotely- collected psychophysiological health-related biomarkers (i.e., heart rate variability data) using pre-mailed Polar H10 chest bands, and health-related questionnaire reports. Distancing training is expected to result in longitudinal reductions in self-reported negative affect, longitudinal increases in positive affect, and longitudinal increases in HRV that are larger than those attributable to reinterpretation training and no-regulation control training."

            "The pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection has resulted, in addition to the well-known acute symptoms, in the emergence of persistent, diffuse and heterogeneous symptoms referred to as persistent COVID.\n\nCommon symptoms include fatigue, shortness of breath, and cognitive dysfunction, among others, and result in an impact on daily functioning. Symptoms may be new onset, appear after initial recovery from an acute episode of COVID-19, or persist after the initial illness. Cardiac variability (HRV) was initially used in COVID-19 to predict mortality in the acute setting. Dysautonomia which partly evaluates HRV is frequent in patients with persistent COVID. Several groups have used voice or other respiratory noise analysis for the diagnosis of acute COVID.\n\nPatients in the persistent COVID cohort will be able to be differentiated from an age, sex and vaccination status matched cohort of recovered COVID patients without sequelae by means of a model created by Machine Learning that will be trained using cardiac variability (HRV), skin conductance and acoustic analysis data. The primary objetive will be to obtain a classification algorithm by Machine Learning to differentiate the group of patients with persistent COVID diagnosis from the paired group of recovered COVID patients without sequelae."

            "Long COVID is a common but highly debilitating illness which develops after infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2 or COVID-19). It is thought to affect as many as 1 in 7 people following COVID-19 infection. It can produce a vast array of symptoms including fatigue, breathlessness, fast heart rate, blood pressure disturbance, temperature disturbance, and dry mouth. Many of these symptoms could be explained by the nervous system being predominantly in a stress or 'fight or flight' response, also known as dysautonomia. One way of assessing whether this is the case is by measuring heart rate variability (HRV). This is the time variation between heart beats and is a marker of how stressed the nervous system is or how strong is the 'fight or flight' response. Heart rate variability can be measured using devices which are worn round the wrist or attach to the chest. An increased variability in heart rate corresponds with a more relaxed nervous system and decreased variability with a more stressed nervous system. Monitoring HRV in real-time and implementing interventions such as a breathing regime to maximise HRV is known as HRV biofeedback. The body can be trained out of the fight or flight response and into the 'rest and digest' mode response of the nervous system in this way and potentially significantly improve symptoms. We propose that for people with Long COVID, a programme of structured breathing exercises over 4 weeks whilst tracking HRV can demonstrate an improvement in HRV and consequently improve Long COVID symptoms."

However, there are limited knowledge about possibility to affect health outcomes in adolescents through exercises programs introduced into physical education (PE) lesson. Moreover, there is lack of the studies identifying people who do not respond to stimuli, as well as examining potential determinants of non-responsiveness. Thirdly, there are no studies examining the modification of exercise dose that should be reflected in the response in such individuals.\n\nAim of this human experiment is to examine the effects of one cycle of 8-weeks high-intensity interval training (HIIT) implemented in physical education lesson on: (1) body composition (proportions of the body fat to the body muscles), (2) resting blood pressure, (3) physical efficiency.\n\nStudy are conducted for two years (two cycles). Each year 300 students of two secondary schools, are involved in project: 15-16-year-olds in first year, 18-19-year-olds in second year. Students are divided in experimental groups -performing 8-weeks (twice a week) cycle of HIIT implemented into PE lesson, and the control groups - students following a typical PE programme. Each cycle consists of two parts. First part is related to the 8 weeks of HIIT training, while second part is related to the dose-expose study.\n\nAll participants are examined during project before (Pre), after (Post) and Follow-Up intervention. Second part is planned after a break of several months. Persons who do not respond to the exercise stimulus in the first part will follow individually modified programmes. They will be measured before and after this additional training.\n\nTo examine the assumed HIIT-induced changes in participants the investigators will apply: (1) anthropometric measurements: body height and weight, and BMI will be calculated, (2) body mass composition (fat and muscle mass), (3) resting blood pressure, (4) beep test which is field motor specific test to assess physical efficiency.\n\nThe results of this project will help to answer the fundamental questions about HIIT induced morphological and physiological effects in adolescents, what is important from scientific and public health point of view. Particularly, in view of the growing pandemic of obesity, common elevated blood pressure and steadily declining physical fitness in children and adolescents."

            "Physical exercise induces numerous changes in the body in a complex signalling network caused by or in response to increased metabolic activity of contracting skeletal muscles.\n\nThe application of omics analytical techniques such as proteomics and metabolomics in the field of sport allows us to understand how the human body responds to exercise and how sports results can be improved by optimising nutrition and training. Both omics techniques offer a quantitative measurement of the metabolic profiles associated with exercise and are able to identify metabolic signatures of athletes from different sports disciplines.\n\nBasketball is a high-intensity exercise modality interspersed with low-intensity. The performance requirements of basketball include aerobic and anaerobic metabolism, with anaerobic metabolism being considered the main energy system. Therefore, basketball players need great athletic ability to produce a successful performance during competition.\n\nFor optimal sports performance it is important to adjust the training load, i.e. the degree of effort that the player can withstand in a single training session. Coaches require effective and objective load monitoring tools that allow them to make decisions about training plans based on the needs of each player.\n\nMicrosampling systems emerge as an alternative to venipuncture by facilitating self-sampling, which can be carried out outside healthcare centres, in a comfortable and precise way from a small finger prick that the user can perform. These systems are less expensive and can be effective in measuring the levels of glucose metabolism products, such as lactate, through the application of metabolomics and proteomics. On the other hand, the use of non-invasive methods of measuring lactate levels is becoming increasingly popular in sports medicine. The use of saliva as an alternative fluid to the blood shows promise for identifying the concentrations of metabolites that occur during and after sports training."

            "Community service providers (CSPs), such as promotores and other community health staff, play an essential role in preserving health and treating disease in underserved Hispanic/Latinx (HL) communities with disproportionately high rates of cardiometabolic (CM) disease. Although effective programs have been developed that deploy CSPs to reduce CM disease risk in the community, to our knowledge no interventions have sought to reduce CM risk among CSPs themselves. However, CSPs are also at high risk for adverse CM outcomes, as they have the same high-risk demographics as the communities they serve and they work in high-stress, frontline jobs. Reducing CM risk among HL CSPs is crucial to promote health at both the individual and community levels; that is, preventive interventions delivered to CSPs may not only promote the health of the individual CSPs who receive the intervention but also may bolster CSPs to more effectively deliver programming that protects CM health community-wide. The proposed study employs relational savoring (RS), a brief intervention rooted in positive psychology and attachment, which has previously been shown to promote psychosocial well-being and which is particularly efficacious in HL populations. Emerging research supports that RS may also promote more optimal cardiovascular regulation and health behavior. Therefore, the investigators deliver RS to CSPs in order to identify CM health protective effects for both CSPs and the high-risk communities they serve.\n\nAims and Hypotheses:\n\nAim 1: Examine effects of RS on CSPs' CM risk factors and outcomes. Hypotheses: RS (compared to wait-list control) will be associated with lower CM risk, as indexed by higher mean HRV, both during a stressor and at rest (H1A). RS will also be associated with a more favorable CM health behavior profile, indexed by higher quality sleep, more exercise, and healthier diet (H1B). Aim 2: Examine effects of RS on CSPs' delivery of CM health programming to the community. Hypotheses: RS will be associated both with reduced threats to CSPs leaving the workforce, including higher satisfaction with work, greater agency, and lower burnout (H2A), and with a higher number of community members reached for CM health programming, as indexed by number of days CSP worked, number of health-related events offered by CSPs, community attendance at events, and retention of community members across multi-day programs (H2B)."

People with severe depression may develop serious psychotic symptoms (e.g., delusions) and have higher mortality and disability than those with mild and moderate depression.\n\nTraditional moderate-intensity continuous training (MICT) (e.g., Baduanjin Qigong) has proved to be effective in preventing and alleviating depressive symptoms among older adults. However, older adults with mental illnesses have poorer engagement and compliance with MICT programs. In recent years, as a novel type of exercise, high-intensity interval training (HIIT), which includes repeated bouts of high-intensity effort followed by varied recovery times, appears to be a promising approach for overcoming limitations in traditional MICT programs.\n\nConsidering there is little evidence of HIIT benefits related to older adults with depression, the current study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of a 16-week HIIT intervention on depressive symptoms and other health-related outcomes among Hong Kong Chinese older adults."

According to the model of Herold and his colleagues, there are two modalities of simultaneous combined training: Thinking While Moving (TwM), when the additional cognitive task is not linked to the motor task, and Moving While Thinking (MwT), when the cognitive task is integrated into the motor task. They assume the latter approach is the most promising for improving cognitive reserve. Nevertheless, to the investigators' knowledge, only one study has compared these two modalities in older adults and none has broadened the question by comparing several MwT trainings.\n\nThe goal of this interventional study will be to compare the cognitive, dual-task, and physical effects of 6 physical and/or cognitive programs in healthy but inactive older adults. The main questions it will aims to answer are:\n\n* Will the Moving While Thinking and Thinking While Moving programs have the same effects?\n* If they have different effects, which will be the best way to improve cognitive, dual-task, and physical functions? The study is being set up between 2023 and 2025 to compare the cognitive, dual- ask and physical effects of 6 programs (3 months, 2 sessions of 1 hour per week). Three experimental MwT programs will be studied: Immersive and interactive wall exergames (I2WE), Complex Cognitive and Motor Activities (2CMA), and exergames with Switch (EXER). They will be compared to an experimental TwM program of stationary bike simultaneous to the Switch (Video games + bike) and 2 control programs: inactive video games (VG) and stationary bike (BIKE). A control group (CON) will be also created.\n\nCognitive, dual-task, and physical pre-tests (before the program), post-tests (after the program), and retention tests (3 months after the end of the program) will be realized to evaluate the effects of the programs."

As a consequence, overweight and obesity at an early age is already considered a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO), with a high incidence in developed countries.\n\nThe abuse of new technologies has remained at worrying levels in the post-COVID period, favoring an increase in the adolescent population considered sedentary. In this regard, up to 70% of adolescents show sedentary behaviors, especially affecting the time spent on screens by both males (93.8%) and females (87.2%). Thus, the use of the cell phone has been shown to be a determining factor, since between 10% and 16% of adolescents show a problematic use of this device, affecting, among other aspects, their behavior during their free time.\n\nIn recent years there has been an increase in sedentary time among adolescents and a decrease in the practice of physical activity that has favored a greater accumulation of body fat and increased the probability of being overweight or obese. In this context, some studies have tried to encourage the practice of physical activity in the school context in overweight and obese population, being these interventions effective to improve body composition.\n\nHowever, these interventions also have their detractors, who argue that the hours of Physical Education are too limited to dedicate so much time to a single content, and that the pedagogical component is often overlooked in their implementation. As an alternative to the above, it has been suggested that Physical Education classes could be used to promote interventions that encourage adolescents to practice physical activity in their free time, and mobile applications could be used to monitor the activity carried out by adolescents, but also as an element that generates adherence and enjoyment in this population. Research in this population using these technologies is scarce, therefore, this project aims to determine the effectiveness of a ten-week intervention promoted from the subject of physical education in which a mobile application is used after school hours on physical activity, body composition and fitness in overweight or obese adolescents."

Cancer, certain cancer drugs, radiation therapy, cancer-associated lifestyle disturbances, and cancer-independent comorbidities combine to predispose cancer survivors to autonomic dysfunction (AD). Reduced heart rate variability (HRV) has been described in various cancer cohorts. Furthermore, these markers of AD have been implicated in adverse outcomes in oncology patients, including increased mortality, exercise limitation, and fatigue. However, data are largely derived from small studies with methodological limitations, and the contribution of AD to overall morbidity and mortality in cancer survivors is not well understood.\n\nThe objective is to determine the feasibility and agreement of remote evaluation of resting heart rate and HRV using the commercially available WHOOP\u00ae wrist monitor, compared to in-office measurements using AtCor Medical SphygmoCor HRV Software, in a cohort of 40 St. Jude Life Study participants with a history of mantle radiation for management of Hodgkin lymphoma."

As such, the creation of an evidence base of patient data will be important in understanding behaviours related to physical activity that are associated with pain, mood, quality of life and disease phenotypes in individuals with Fabry disease.\n\nThese will be tracked through a combination of hospital medical records, a thigh-worn physical activity device worn over a period of seven days, real-time data collected from a wrist-worn device and patient-reported outcomes. By combining a patient's data into a digital patient profile, the aim is to provide patients and clinicians with better insight into physical activity behaviours that may be considered targets for interventions for improved care and quality of life.\n\nIndividuals with Fabry disease aged 18 years or above will be considered for eligibility screening.
