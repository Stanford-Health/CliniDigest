The study focuses on adult patients in general surgical wards who need regular blood glucose checks due to the risk of low or high blood sugar levels.\n\nThe goal is to learn if using a continuous glucose monitoring system is better than fingerstick monitoring in managing glucose levels, preventing complications, improving patient satisfaction and experience, reducing nursing staff workload, and improving nursing staff' experience. The study also compares the accuracy of glucose readings from the continuous glucose monitoring system with those from fingerstick tests and blood samples.\n\nThe hypothesis is that CGMS is accurate and effective for monitoring glucose levels in surgical patients. This could lead to better blood sugar control, fewer complications, shorter hospital stays, and improved experiences for both patients and nursing staff."

            "Approximately 20% of adults have prediabetes in Germany. Prediabetes is defined as a condition with glucose levels outside the normal range but not yet meeting the criteria for type 2 diabetes. The pathogenesis of prediabetes, as well as of type 2 diabetes, involves whole-body insulin resistance associated with inadequate insulin secretion. These two central processes of glucose regulation are modulated by the brain. The brain communicates via the autonomic nervous system (ANS) with metabolically important organs in the periphery to modulate insulin sensitivity and insulin secretion. These processes are impaired in individuals with prediabetes and diabetes. An ANS sympathovagal imbalance has also been observed in individuals with prediabetes. There are no specific therapeutic approaches to improve ANS sympathovagal imbalance. It is assumed that resonant frequency breathing (RFB) maximizes heart rate variability (HRV) through rhythmization of breathing, heartbeat, and blood pressure. Through this state of coherence, the activity of the parasympathetic nervous system is upregulated, and the activity of the sympathetic nervous system is suppressed, leading to an increase in modulation of ANS activity. Several studies have demonstrated that heart rate variability-biofeedback (HRV-BF) interventions improve HRV, reduce stress and anxiety, and alleviate symptoms in patients with various medical conditions. To the best of current knowledge, no study has investigated the effect of HRV-BF-RFB on glucose metabolism. Therefore, the proposed randomized controlled non-blinded trial aims to gain evidence about the effect of HRV-BF-RFB compared to an anti-stress program on glucose metabolism in individuals with prediabetes. Glucose metabolism is characterized using the 75 g oral glucose tolerance test. There are two potential mechanisms by which HRV-BF-RFB may improve glucose metabolism in individuals with prediabetes: (a) a 0\u00b0-phase relationship between heart oscillations and breathing, maximizing the amplitude of respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA), and (b) activation of the cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway. The investigators hypothesized that in individuals with prediabetes, the HRV-BF-RFB intervention will improve glucose metabolism and glucose variability."

            "Type 2 diabetes (T2D), a prevalent metabolic disorder impacting \\>3 million Canadians, is characterized by insulin resistance and high blood glucose. Chronically elevated blood glucose (i.e., hyperglycemia) and swings in glucose (i.e., glucose variability) contribute to complications of T2D. Specifically, post-meal hyperglycemic spikes are independent risk factors for cardiovascular disease and mortality. People with T2D often exhibit a different circadian pattern from healthy individuals, with higher glucose excursions in the morning, after breakfast. This makes breakfast a crucial meal in achieving glycemic control. One strategy to reduce or eliminate this high glucose excursion is to consume a low-carbohydrate breakfast. Our recently published 3-month clinical trial (Oliveira et al., AJCN 2023) - funded by the Egg Farmers of Canada (EFC) \\& Egg Nutrition Center (ENC) - highlighted the positive impact of a simple dietary intervention, where individuals were advised to consume an egg-based, low-carbohydrate breakfast. This intervention led to improved glycemic control assessed by continuous glucose monitoring and reduced overall energy and carbohydrate intake when compared to a low-fat guideline breakfast. While we saw a within-group reduction HbA1c in the egg-based low-carbohydrate breakfast group, the between group difference did not reach statistical significance. Since HbA1c reflects the average glucose over the preceding 3 months, likely, our previous study's duration was not long enough to demonstrate significant reductions in HbA1c. For a low-carbohydrate breakfast to be recognized as an evidence-based strategy in nutrition and clinical practice guidelines, a longer-term study that demonstrates reductions in HbA1c is needed.\n\nCollectively, our promising early results demonstrate that the time is right and that our team is poised to deliver a longer, well-powered randomized controlled trial (RCT) to solidify low-carbohydrate breakfasts as an evidence-based strategy to improve glucose control and improve health outcomes for people living with T2D."

The investigators are searching for ways to make the beneficial effects of RYGB available to most type 2 diabetes patients rather than a select few that undergo RYGB.\n\nThe investigators believe that parts of RYGB can be medically reproduced through a combination of diet and medicine. Once weekly injectable GLP-1 medicine that leads to weight loss and improved blood sugar control in type 2 diabetes are now FDA approved. Optifast is a medically supervised diet that safely reduces calorie intake to 800 calories per day for three months by replacing normal meals with specially prepared bars and shakes which leads to weight loss and improved blood sugar control in type 2 diabetes. Normal meals are then gradually reintroduced over 6 weeks and the bars/shakes are stopped.

            "Military personnel and athletes have a very high energy expenditure, which is increased during certain key periods (intense training, competition and missions). Compensating for this expenditure through adequate energy intake can be complicated by physiological ingestive limits and logistical and organizational constraints (number of meals, food availability), leading these populations to regularly find themselves in an energy deficit situation (intake below requirements). If this situation persists, it could impair physical and cognitive performance, as well as major physiological functions. Among the many constraints to which military personnel and athletes are subjected (stress, sleep deprivation, travel, etc.) that can increase the risk of energy deficiency, the impact of thermal environmental constraints is very imperfectly known. Seasonal impact and travel to countries with very different thermal environments from temperate countries can lead these populations to work in cold and hot conditions for long periods.\n\nUnderstanding how exposure to hot and cold alters appetite and energy intake is therefore of the high importance. Our previous \"TEMPCA\" study highlighted a modulation of preferences for warm or cold foods depending on the exposure environment. By being able to adapt their food intake to these preferences, subjects were able to maintain a decent energy intake.\n\nThe primary objective of this study is to determine the effect of the temperature of the food served (hot or cold) on changes in food intake during acute exposure to hot and cold. We hypothesized that adapting the temperature of the food served according to the exposure environment (hot in a cold environment and cold in a hot environment) would enable adequate levels of energy intake.\n\nSecondary objectives are to determine the influence of the environment on the levels of interstitial glucose during the preprandial period and to investigate the impact of thermal exposure (modulation of core temperature) on the modulation of quantities consumed and energy produced by digestion (postprandial thermogenesis). Forty participants (between 18 and 40 yo, male or female, active, lean, and healthy) will carry out 3 experimental sessions in which only the thermal environment will differ: cold condition (15\u00b0C), neutral condition (25\u00b0C) and warm condition (35\u00b0C). They will be divided into two groups, the first of which will be offered a cold meal during the three sessions (Cold Meal - CM) and the second a warm meal during the three sessions (Warm Meal - WM). They will all wear the same outfit designed to be offer perfect thermal comfort at 25 \u00b0C.\n\nBriefly, each session will start at 8:30am after eating a standardized breakfast. Body mass and ad libitum water intake will be frequently monitored to identify possible dehydration. Thermal comfort and sensation and subjective appetite will be regularly assessed using visual analog scale.\n\nFrom 11:00am to 01:00pm, all participants will be isolated and all temporal cues will be removed. At 01:00pm, an ad libitum meal (warm or cold) will be served in large quantities. The dishes will be weighed before and after the meal to assess energy intake. Before and after the meal, resting metabolism will be measured during 30 min in a supine position using indirect calorimetry and food preferences for high-fat/low-fat, savory/sweet, warm/cold foods, and fluid/solid foods will be assessed using the Leeds Food Preference Questionnaire."

            "Type 1 diabetes (T1D) results from destruction of insulin producing beta cells by the body's own immune system (autoimmunity) causing an individual to lose the ability to make enough insulin to control their blood sugar levels and need to have insulin injections to lower blood glucose levels. Whilst high blood sugar level is a problem for people with Type 1 diabetes, taking insulin medication to lower sugar levels, delayed meals and exercise can all result in dangerously low blood sugar levels (hypoglycaemia). The biological causes of hypoglycaemia, and ways to prevent it are poorly understood. In non-diabetic individuals, a hormone called glucagon is secreted naturally to raise blood glucose levels but it is unclear why glucagon secretion is impaired during hypoglycaemia in individuals with T1D.\n\nThe aim of this prospective observational study is to test the relationship between a glucagon stimulation test and risk of hypoglycaemia in T1D. It is hoped this research will establish whether this relationship could be used as a blood test and be a clinically useful biomarker of hypoglycaemia risk and, therefore, directly inform clinical care of people with T1D, particularly those with highest risk of hypoglycaemia.\n\nAssessment of beta cell decline has traditionally relied on timed C-peptide measures following a standardised liquid meal known as the mixed meal tolerance test (MMTT). Home finger prick blood spot C-peptide measurement might be a practical, cheap, and non-invasive alternative to a MMTT and would allow regular assessment of beta cell function over time. If proven that this sample type is a robust alternative to the gold standard MMTT venous C-peptide, it would dramatically decrease the cost and participant burden of T1D research into beta cell function."

It may occur with or without insulin resistance, insulin secretion defect, or impaired biological function of insulin. The condition is characterized by chronic hyperglycemia and targeted damage to multiple systems and organs. Insulin pump therapy is an advanced method for managing diabetes that mimics the natural secretion of insulin by providing continuous delivery to diabetic patients. Compared to traditional multiple injections, the use of an insulin pump reduces the number of injections required and improves patient compliance and treatment convenience. The medical team can customize the insulin pump treatment based on each patient's specific situation in order to achieve optimal blood sugar control and effectively reduce the risk of complications. In recent years, there has been significant attention given to glucose-in-target time (TIR), which refers to the amount of time blood sugar levels are within a range of 3.9 to 10.0 mmol/L in non-pregnant adults measured either as minutes or as a percentage (%).

Neither they nor their care providers will be able to see their CGM glucose levels (the blinded CGM is simply for outcome measurement, not an intervention). As per usual clinical practice, only the SMBG glucose levels will be available to assist in insulin adjustment.\n* The change between baseline to 6 months in CGM-derived glucose percent time-in- range will be compared between groups (first primary study endpoint).\n\nFor the second six months, months 7-12:\n\n* The control group will switch to unblinded CGM months 7-12 (their data months 7-12 months will be compared to their data months 1-6 as part of the primary endpoint assessment).\n* The patients who wore the unblinded CGM months 1-6 will continue for another 6 months to assess the impact of wearing the CGM for 12 continuous months (a secondary endpoint).\n\nOnce the clinical portion of the study is complete, study investigators who are health economists from the Uganda Ministry of Health will perform a costs analysis (second primary endpoint)."

            "Links between sleep and food intake are manyfold. In healthy individuals, sleep deprivation promotes obesity by stimulating food intake of high glycemic index (GI) foods. Conversely, high GI foods induce sleepiness. Obesity is observed in 30-50% of patients with Narcolepsy type 1 (NT1). Its determinism may involve transient changes in basal metabolism at the early stage of the disease, eating disorders, disrupted nighttime sleep and sleepiness. In contrast, patients suffering from idiopathic hypersomnia (IH), whose nocturnal sleep is generally long and of good quality, rarely present with obesity. By studying the relationships between diet, body composition and sleep patterns in these two populations and in healthy controls, the NARCOFOOD study aims to provide a better understanding of the determinants of obesity in narcolepsy and, more generally, of the effects of food intake on sleepiness.\n\nPatients will be recruited at the Lyon and Clermont-Ferrand sleep centers and Controls at the Lyon Neuroscience Research Center. Data from clinical evaluation (including body mass index and body composition), and questionnaires (sleep quality, insomnia, sleepiness, anxiety and depression, impulsivity, eating behaviors) will be collected. During 4 days, at home, the following parameters will be explored : 1) eating behaviors (meals' photos) and sugar consumption (FreeStylePro sensor measuring interstitial glucose) 2) sleep/wake rhythm (diary and actigraphy) 3) nocturnal sleep parameters (Somfit device) 4) sleepiness (Karolinska sleepiness scale and EEG markers of sleepiness with the Somfit device) before and after meals.\n\nThe hypothesis is that increased sleepiness would favor food intake of high GI foods, which would worsen sleepiness in all 3 groups, with a more pronounced effect in NT1. Compared to IH patients and controls, NT1 patients may present more snacking of high GI foods, especially at night if sleep is disrupted, and this would be correlated with body composition.\n\nThe findings will help to better understand the mechanisms of obesity in narcolepsy and may lay the ground for the development of new therapeutic strategies in disorders of hypersomnolence, targeting dietary behaviors."

There are more than a thousand bacteria species in our gastrointestinal tract that have an important role in the proper functioning of our body, so our gut microbiome is a key piece for our nutrition and blood glucose control.\n\nNowadays, one of the major public health concerns is the rise of people with diabetes (a disease characterized by an increase in blood glucose) and the increase in obesity, in which one of several risks is diabetes. There are multiple reasons for people develop those diseases, however, some care on diet management can prevent, delay, or improve the effects of these illnesses. Therefore, this study proposes studying the blood glucose variation between healthy volunteers and if there is a relationship between that variation and the intestinal bacteria present. These results can help doctors and nutritionists elaborate a personalized diet for people who need blood glucose level control.\n\nThe investigators are recruiting volunteers aged 18 to 60, healthy, living at Florianopolis and the surroundings to participate in this crossover randomized N-of-1 study. The participants must collect fecal samples. After collection, the participants will meet the investigators and receive a kit containing ten standardized breakfasts, with two kinds of muffins, and a kit containing a glucose monitor (Abbott Freestyle Libre-CE marked) to monitor their blood sugar levels.

To address these questions, this project will conduct a state-of-the-art adaptive dose finding study under controlled laboratory conditions to determine the minimally effective dose (the smallest dose) that yields cardiometabolic benefit for two separate sedentary break elements (frequency and duration). Study findings will ultimately determine how often and for how long people should break up periods of prolonged sedentary time to transiently improve established cardiovascular risk factors; key foundational information critical to the success of future long-term trials and ultimately public health guidelines.\n\nPrimary Aim: To determine the minimally effective dose combination(s) of frequency and duration needed to provide cardiometabolic benefit during an 8-hour experimentation period. Specifically, the study will determine:\n\n1a. For each fixed duration, the minimum sedentary break frequency (e.g., every 30 min, 60 min, 120 min) that demonstrates a reduction in systolic BP, diastolic BP, or glucose compared with a sedentary control condition.\n\n1b.

To address this need, the maximally tolerated dose (the highest dose that does not cause undue physical/psychological distress) for frequency and duration of sedentary breaks will also be determined via assessment of 4 constructs: physical exhaustion/fatigue, affect (e.g., mood, emotion), tolerability (e.g., completion of dose protocol), and safety (e.g., hypoglycemia).

            "Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) is a major chronic lifestyle-related disorder with a significant impact on quality and costs of care. As patients with T2DM often have insufficient knowledge about proper self-management and are insufficiently motivated for a lifestyle change, interventions with more motivational strategies and personalization are needed. The use of real-time monitoring of glucose values, nutrition and physical activity in combination with coaching aimed at lifestyle-related behavior change may improve patients' diabetes management. Therefore, ZGT, UT and RRD developed the Diameter app. The aim of phase 2 of this study is to investigate the Diameter as blended-care using a feasibility study. The primary objective of this feasibility study is to assess intervention usage and acceptability of the Diameter as a blended-care intervention in secondary care, of which some are also following a combined lifestyle intervention (GLI). Secondary objectives are to explore behavioral (e.g. physical activity), physiological (e.g. BMI), psychological (e.g. health-related quality of life) and clinical outcomes (e.g. glucose control, estimated HbA1c values).\n\nThis study has a mixed-method design with 3 (regular participants) or 4 (participants who decide to follow the Combined Lifestyle Intervention (GLI) COOL next to the Diameter during the study period) data collection points.\n\nPatients will start with a two-week period of baseline measurements. Subsequently, patients will use the Diameter as a blended-care intervention for 10 weeks. The two-week measurement periods will be repeated twice (T1: week 13-14 and at T2: week 25-26). Between T1 and T2, patients will use a version of the Diameter without daily coaching messages. At T1 and T2, questionnaires will be administered, data on physical activity, food intake and glucose values will be logged, and blood and urine samples will be retrieved from regular care measurements. In addition, open-ended interviews will be performed with 10-15 patients at T1.

This suggests the need to develop interventions to reduce DKA events. Innovative features of newer continuous glucose monitoring devices offer opportunities for novel strategies to reduce DKA. Designating a family member, friend, or caregiver as a Follower was associated with reduction in HbA1C, increased time in range, and improvement in quality of life metrics in people with T1DM. However, the previously published studies are limited as they were either retrospective, survey-based, or do not overlap with our proposed cohort involving adults ages 18-65 with T1DM (prior prospective studies involved either pregnant women with T1DM or adults \u226560 years of age with T1DM). This study is a randomized controlled trial pilot study to evaluate the effectiveness of an intervention (FAM) using a Follower, Action Plan, and Remote Monitoring of glucose data to reduce severe hyperglycemia, a modifiable risk factor for DKA, in adults with T1DM at high risk for DKA. The intervention uses real-time glucose data sharing with a Follower (family member, friend, or caregiver) and personalized diabetes education provided to the dyad (person with T1DM and their chosen Follower).

            "Diabetes mellitus (diabetes) is a chronic condition that represents a major public health and clinical concern. Self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG) is a critical part of the care of individuals with diabetes. SMBG entails capillary fingerstick blood glucose testing multiple times per day. Many people with diabetes find this testing painful and cumbersome, often resulting in poor compliance to a glucose self-monitoring schedule. Furthermore, SMBG only provides limited visibility on daily and nightly glucose profiles, meaning that hypo- and hyperglycaemic episodes can be missed or detected with delay. The use of minimally invasive continuous glucose monitoring devices (CGMs) in diabetes management circumvents these challenges as CGMs measure glucose every few minutes over a period of 1-2 weeks through a sensor with a fine needle that is inserted once into a user's arm or abdomen. This enables periodic glucose measurement without repeat finger pricks and provides the user with a detailed glucose profile over the entire wear time of the sensor, thus enabling better adjustment of therapy or behaviour.\n\nIn populations where CGMs are accessible to people with diabetes as standard of care and without additional cost, many people with type 1 diabetes have switched from SMBG via fingerstick to the use of CGMs permanently, using the devices continuously. This is rarely possibly for people with type 1 diabetes in the public sector in LMICs as CGMs are not provided as standard of care. Little data on effectiveness, feasibility, acceptability, and cost of the use of CGMs in LMIC populations is available to inform clinical models for the integration of CGMs into diabetes management. Furthermore, it has not been investigated if intermittent, as opposed to continuous use of CGMs provides clinical benefit. Intermittent use could be beneficial for people with diabetes who do not have the means to pay for continuous use of CGMs.\n\nThis study aims to evaluate the effectiveness, feasibility, acceptability, and cost of intermittent and continuous use of CGM among people with type 1 diabetes in South Africa."

It can be indicative of (i) Type 2 Diabetes or (ii) stress hyperglycaemia (diagnostic threshold for blood sugar varies according to learned societies, with HbA1c \\< 6.5%).\n* Hyperglycaemia occurs in known diabetic ACS subjects Most studies use admission blood sugar as a predictor. However, it has recently been shown that glycemic variability indexes would be better predictors of MACE. Using continuous glucose measurement for 48 h, it has been shown that significant glycemic variability is a more powerful predictor of MACE at 1 year than admission glycemia The measurement of glycemic variability is mainly possible thanks to the development of CGM (continuous glucose measurement).\n\nTo our knowledge, no study has been interested in evaluating the predictive value of the various glycemic parameters measured by CGM.\n\nPublished studies have used continuous glucose measurements for very short periods (24 or 72 hours maximum), which limits these measurements.\n\nThe freestyle libre Pro iQ (FSLPro iQ) is a professional sensor for continuous, non-invasive interstitial glucose measurement allowing the recording of glycemic parameters for 2 weeks.\n\nOur hypothesis is that glycaemic parameters, alone or in combination with each other or with other patient risk factors, measured with the Freestyle libre Pro iQ have a significant prognostic value in terms of cardiovascular clinical events at 12 months in a population of patients with ACS managed as standard and followed up."

None of the previous studies of intensive glucose management used CGM technology. Whether near normal glucose levels can be achieved without increasing hypoglycemia among hospitalized patients with diabetes with the advent of CGM technology is not known.\n\nThere are clear associations between hyperglycemia and poor outcomes in patients with diabetes hospitalized with infection, including COVID-19. The COVID-19 pandemic has increased the urgency to definitively answer the question of whether glucose lowering below 140-180 mg/dL can be achieved without increasing hypoglycemia.\n\nIf this proposed study demonstrates intensive management of glucose to a target of 90 to 130 mg/dL without hypoglycemia is achievable in the inpatient setting with CGM technology, a larger study could then be performed to evaluate whether there is clinical benefit including a reduction in morbidity and mortality.\n\nThe primary study hypothesis is that glucose management with CGM can achieve a mean glucose of 90-130 mg/dL without increasing hypoglycemia compared with standard care with a glucose target of 140-180 mg/dL.

            "Introduction\n\n16.8% of the Danish adult population are obese (Body Mass Index\\> 30 kg / m2). Obesity increases the risk of lifestyle diseases such as type-2 diabetes and non-alcoholic fatty liver. People with mental illness have an increased risk of developing obesity. Both obesity and certain mental disorders (bipolar disorder and schizophrenia) are associated with circadian rhythm disorders. Clinically, this may manifest as reduced sleep quality, depressive symptoms and increased fatigue, but also deregulation of a wide range of bodily processes subject to the circadian rhythm.\n\nIn circadian rhythm disorders, the pattern of how mRNA of specific 'clock genes' is expressed in the cell may be affected. These clock genes are associated with obesity, bipolar disorder and schizophrenia. Despite the clear indications of an interplay between mental illness, obesity and circadian rhythm disorders, the relationship between these illnesses are largely unexplored.\n\nAim\n\nThe aim of this study is to investigate circadian disturbances in people with and without obesity, as well as people with obesity and a comorbid diagnosis of either schizophrenia or bipolar disorder.\n\nMethods\n\nThe study population will consist of:\n\n1. People with obesity and schizophrenia (N=22)\n2. People with obesity and bipolar disorder (N=22)\n3. People with obesity without psychiatric disease (N=22)\n4. People with BMI 18.5 - 25kg/m2 and no psychiatric disease (N=20)\n\nStudy Procedure\n\nParticipants will visit the clinic 2 times. At each visit participants fill in questionnaires and perform physical tests. Between visit 1 and 2, participants will over a 2-day period (at-home), collect biological samples (Four hair- and six saliva samples per day). In addition, participants will wear accelerometers and continuous glucose monitors (CGMs) for a total of 8 days, including the 2-day sampling period.\n\nSampled hair follicles are analyzed for relative expression of clock gene mRNA. Saliva is analyzed for cortisol- and melatonin content. The four participants groups are analyzed and compared on daytime variation in mRNA expression, cortisol- and melatonin concentration, and body temperature.\n\nPerspectives\n\nA comparison of patient groups presenting with mental disease, obesity and circadian disturbances may provide new insight into the association between these diseases."

            "Objectives The aim of this intervention is to assess how well and how efficiently the O2O Service Model works in delivering primary healthcare and managing chronic diseases for patients living in Pyeongchang-gun at the local government level.\n\nTrial design This is a randomized controlled trial with restricted, batch, blocked and individual random assignment. Investigators will allocate 1,000 participants from Pyeongchang-gun into two groups: one with diabetes (and pre-diabetes) and one with hypertension (including borderline cases), focusing on poorly controlled patients. As participants visit local health centers, their data will be sent to the research team for blocked randomization based on disease type, severity, and region. Assignment results will be communicated back to the centers and patients.\n\nStudy setting The intervention will take place in Pyeongchang-gun, Kangwon-do, South Korea. The Smart Healthcare Center affiliated to Public Medical Center of Pyeongchang will primarily manage the O2O service by providing necessary education and human resources while receiving and monitoring data from each participant and local medical centers. The overall study (including the design of trial) is managed by Seoul National University College of Medicine while the provision of O2O service and data collection are primarily in charge of Smart Healthcare Center of Pyeongchang.\n\nIntervention in O2O Service Model:\n\nAfter initial health exams, each patient gets a custom care plan, classifying their disease and care level. The Pyeongchang Smart Healthcare Center, with doctors, tracks patients via an online platform, sending automated health messages. High-risk patients receive a two-week glucose monitor and guidance on lifestyle adjustments. Doctors access patient health records through the participant's personal online datastore (POD), with consent, integrating health and prescription history from national insurance, and can assess heart disease risk.\n\nSample size The trial's sample size is determined using the MDES(Minimum Detectable Effect Size), with 1,000 participants divided equally between diabetes and hypertension groups. Each group is then split into treatment and control subgroups through random allocation. The MDES calculation, accounting for an explained outcome variation of 50% due to blocking and controls, and based on 500 subjects per group with equal allocation, aims for a high-accuracy effect size of 0.216 at a 5% significance level and 80% power.\n\nAssignment of interventions: allocation Participants will be randomly placed into groups by a computer program. This study uses a specific randomization method that is restricted and organized by individual characteristics. The research team will tell the centers and patients about their group assignment via phone and email. Neither the healthcare staff nor the participants will know the group allocation beforehand. The research team is in charge of the randomization process and informing everyone involved. The staff at Pyeongchang's Smart Healthcare Center will sign up participants and manage their placement into the assigned intervention groups. There will be no blinding after participants are assigned to their groups.\n\nList of Data For the study, the investigators have created questionnaires and interview formats to collect various data types, including random assignment records, baseline information, outcomes, service usage and costs, demographic and health details, physician-collected health records, life-log data from apps or web, clinical exam results, and service effectiveness and efficiency from the perspective of medical staff and administrators.\n\nStatistical methods For the analysis of primary and secondary outcomes, the investigators will employ ITT(Intention-to-Treat) and Regression-Adjusted Impact Estimate. When data allows (especially data from control group), the investigators will also conduct timeseries effect analysis. To investigate the time-series changes in program effects across multiple time points, the dependent variable (outcome variable) should be measured at each time point to estimate program effects repeatedly.\n\nData management and monitoring The data management for the study will be conducted using electronic systems for secure and accurate data entry, coding, and storage, with robust checks and backups to ensure data quality, which will be archived for three years in compliance with bioethics standards before disposal according to privacy regulations. Participant confidentiality is prioritized through secure data collection and restricted access, with sharing only to authorized research team members and regulators using password protection or encryption. Additionally, a dedicated Data Monitoring Committee will oversee trial progress and adherence to protocols, while the Smart Healthcare Center collaborates with healthcare workers to manage patient services, with minimal adverse events expected."

            "Use of Continuous Glucose Monitoring Devices Among People Living With Type 1 Diabetes in Kenya.",
            "Diabetes mellitus (diabetes) is a chronic condition that represents a major public health and clinical concern. Self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG) is a critical part of the care of individuals with diabetes. SMBG entails capillary fingerstick blood glucose testing multiple times per day. Many people with diabetes find this testing painful and cumbersome, often resulting in poor compliance to a glucose self-monitoring schedule. Furthermore, SMBG only provides limited visibility on daily and nightly glucose profiles, meaning that hypo- and hyperglycaemic episodes can be missed or detected with delay. The use of minimally invasive continuous glucose monitoring devices (CGMs) in diabetes management circumvents these challenges as CGMs measure glucose every few minutes over a period of 1-2 weeks through a sensor with a fine needle that is inserted once into a user's arm or abdomen. This enables periodic glucose measurement without repeat finger pricks and provides the user with a detailed glucose profile over the entire wear time of the sensor, thus enabling better adjustment of therapy or behaviour.\n\nIn populations where CGMs are accessible to people with diabetes as standard of care and without additional cost, many people with type 1 diabetes have switched from SMBG via fingerstick to the use of CGMs permanently, using the devices continuously. This is rarely possibly for people with type 1 diabetes in the public sector in LMICs as CGMs are not provided as standard of care. Little data on effectiveness, feasibility, acceptability, and cost of the use of CGMs in LMIC populations is available to inform clinical models for the integration of CGMs into diabetes management. Furthermore, it has not been investigated if intermittent, as opposed to continuous use of CGMs provides clinical benefit. Intermittent use could be beneficial for people with diabetes who do not have the means to pay for continuous use of CGMs.\n\nThis study aims to evaluate the effectiveness, feasibility, acceptability, and cost of intermittent and continuous use of CGM among people with type 1 diabetes in Kenya."

            "Repaired Tetralogy of Fallot (rTOF) is the leading cause of congenital cyanotic heart disease worldwide, involving up to 7-10% of congenital heart disease. With advances in open-heart surgical repair techniques and medical therapies, there is a significant increase in patients with rTOF surviving till late adulthood. One sequalae that nearly all rTOF patients develop during their lifetime is significant pulmonary regurgitation. Pulmonary regurgitation causes progressive right ventricular dilatation and systolic dysfunction, which in turn impairs cardio-pulmonary function and overall survival.\n\nThere is currently no pharmacological therapy proven to improve cardio-pulmonary function in rTOF patients. In a double-blind, placebo controlled, randomized controlled trial involving 33 rTOF patients, the use of beta-adrenergic receptor blocker Bisoprolol failed to improve maximal oxygen uptake (VO2 max) in the treatment group. Furthermore, there was no significant change in dimension of right ventricle on cardiac imaging, or heart failure biomarkers including brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) and atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP). In the APPROPRIATE trial involving 64 patients, angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) Ramipril similarly failed to improve VO2 max despite an improved right ventricular long-axis shortening. In REDEFINE trial, 95 rTOF patients were randomized in to receive angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) Losartan and control. At the end of study, there was no significant difference between the two groups in VO2 max, right ventricular ejection fraction, and other key outcomes.\n\nSodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitor is a promising therapy for rTOF patients. Clinical trials consistently demonstrated that SGLT2 inhibitors reduce heart failure hospitalization and mortality among patients with heart failure with or without diabetes mellitus. There have been growing body of evidence that demonstrate that SGLT2 inhibitors improve right ventricular function. In a preclinical study of rat with pulmonary hypertension induced right ventricular failure, empagliflozin was found to reduce pulmonary pressure, alleviate right ventricular hypertrophy and reduce myocardial fibrosis. In a pilot study involving 10 patients with adult congenital heart disease and systemic right ventricular failure, SGLT2 inhibitors improved cardio-pulmonary function as reflected by 6-minute walk test performance and New York Heart Association functional status. Most recently, investigators from DAPA-SERVE randomized controlled trial reported that among 92 patients with systemic right ventricular failure, those randomized to receive SGLT2 inhibitors had superior systemic right ventricular function with larger fractional area change (FAC) and more negative free-wall global longitudinal strain. Nevertheless, as these trials involve patients with right ventricular connections to the systemic circulation rather than pulmonary circulation in rTOF, it is uncertain whether the trial results can be extrapolated to the rTOF population. The critical knowledge gap our proposed randomized controlled trial seeks to address is whether SGLT2 inhibitors improve cardio-pulmonary function in rTOF patients."

Serum hormone measurements and transvaginal ultrasound are more accurate at determining time of ovulation and fertile window, but are costly and inconvenient. Urine-based luteinizing hormone (LH) tests offer improvement. However, LH surge typically occurs 24 to 36 hours prior to ovulation, only capturing the later portion of the fertile window.\n\nA novel approach involves using electrical impedance to track compositional changes in cervical mucus, providing real-time, at-home data. The Kegg device (Lady Technologies Inc, San Francisco, CA, USA) is an intravaginal device that measures cervical mucus impedance to monitor fertility status. Previous studies show it has higher sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy compared to BBT alone in determining the ovulation window.

Lower abdominal pain may be accompanied by vomiting, headache, back pain, diarrhea, fatigue, etc. Depending on the pathophysiology, dysmenorrhea is classified into two types: primary and secondary. Primary dysmenorrhea (PD) is menstrual pain associated with normal ovulatory cycles in the absence of pelvic pathology and a clear physiologic etiology and is most commonly seen in adolescents and young adults. There are numerous studies on PD in the literature, but there is still a lack of studies on which of the non-pharmacologically recommended exercise and other methods is more effective on dysmenorrhea symptoms, sleep and quality of life for individuals with this problem. Different exercise intensities may affect PD symptoms through different mechanisms. Moderate to high intensity exercise may reduce pain by increasing anti-inflammatory cytokines, whereas less intense exercise, such as yoga, affects pain levels by decreasing cortisol levels. The lack of research on which exercise training is more effective in PD individuals was considered as a limitation. In the light of this information, the aim of the investigators study is to compare the effects of different training techniques on dysmenorrhea symptoms, sleep and quality of life in PD treatment and to present the preferability of these techniques based on evidence."

It can also significantly increase an individuals stroke risk. Catheter ablation (CA) for AF is the most effective way to restore normal heart rhythm. However, AF can recur in up to 50% of patients after their first CA procedure and a second 'top-up' procedure may be needed to maximise effect. Early detection of recurrences can enable planning and treatment and repeat CA procedures.\n\nPost-CA follow-up strategies rely on episodic rhythm monitoring (Holter monitor tests) that usually last between 1 and 7 days. However, AF recurrences can be intermittent and may not occur during these short monitoring episodes. A greater duration of monitoring has been shown to yield greater detection of AF recurrences.\n\nRelying on symptoms alone to detect recurrence is also sub-optimal. AF recurrences can also be insidious. Similar symptoms may be reported from ectopy, atrial tachycardias or atrial flutter. These may require different management approaches, necessitating rhythm characterisation before considering a repeat CA.\n\nThe Apple Watch (AW) is a wristwatch that is able to monitor a wearer's heart rate and rhythm regularity as well as facilitating an immediate, real-time single-lead ECG recording. This non-invasive device that can be purchased over- the-counter has demonstrated feasibility in detecting AF and may offer a potential non-invasive, alternative long-term rhythm surveillance strategy to diagnose AF in these patients.\n\nThe investigators propose a single-centre, randomised controlled study to compare the standard follow-up strategy after index AF CA versus one supplemented with an AW-led prolonged monitoring strategy to determine if the latter will improve the expediency and rate of AF recurrence detection. Whether this will lead to improved downstream decision-making, reduction in symptomatic events and a lower prevalence of AF in the longer term will also be studied."

Implantable event monitors (ICM) are the gold standard for continuous heart rhythm monitoring but they have been implemented in very few patients after stroke due to high invasiveness and high costs.\n\nIn this trial, patients with implanted ICMs (Medtronic Reveal LINQ Insertable Cardiac Monitor) will be randomized to use one of two wearables (1:1 Apple Watch or PulseOn) for continuous monitoring. The aim is to compare the probability of detecting an episode of AF with a wearable versus the gold standard ICM.\n\nBoth groups will use the wearable for 12 weeks. If the wearables detect an arrhythmic pulse curve, this is communicated by vibration. By laying the other hand on the device, a 1-channel ECG is performed. ECG data will be transferred regularly to the CoreLab (Universityhospital Leipzig) for analysis.\n\nAfter 12 weeks, the patients will visit the site and answer questions regarding the usability, compliance and satisfaction with the wearables."

            "Axial spondyloarthritis (axSpa) is a chronic inflammatoric autoimmune disease of the back with a prevalence around 1,4% (1) . In patients decreased function and decreased quality of life as well as chronic pain are strong burdens . Despite modern treatments like biological agents just 25% of the patients are at remission (2) . Besides the pharmacological treatment physical activity is known to be very important to gain disease control. A low physical activity is related to a higher disease activity and a high physical activity to better disease control. Until now there is no structured capture of the daily movements of patients with axial spondylarthritis in clinical practice. Our goal is to analyse the relationship between movement and disease activity and to implement concrete recommendations for movement in patients with axSpa.\n\nThe primary objective of the study is to investigate which type, frequency and intensity of movement are helpful in gaining and remaining disease control in patients with axSpa.\n\nMethods This monocentric longitudinal study recordes movement, sport and physical parameters like heart frequency and heart rate variability through an observational period of 6 month via smartwatch. Meanwhile we record disease activity, pain and functional outcomes with regular surveys every two weeks. Patients in every phase of disease are eligible for inclusion, but they do must have an own iPhone due to software reasons. Data is collected in a specially programmed study-app. Fifty participants will be included in this study. Until now we have 24 patients included since april 2024. Patients come to clinic every 3 month as this is our standard in outclinic patients. We than do anamnesis and a physical examination. After the study period of 6 month we transmit the mobility and disease-related data of the surveys of the patients mobile device to our system.\n\nThe primary endpoint is to find exact recommendations for concrete movement in patients with axSpa.\n\nSo this is the first study that wants to give concrete recommendations for movement in patients with axSpa with the help of mobility tracking with smartwatches. This could help to prevent flares and also to recover quicker from a flare.\n\n1.

People with T1D need insulin shots because their body does not make insulin. Insulin lowers blood sugar levels. When blood sugar levels are too high or too low it causes medical problems.\n\nYouth with T1D can really impact their own health if they follow their T1D treatment plan. However, even with the help of doctors, nurses, and family, most adolescents find it hard to follow their diabetes plan close enough to meet their A1C goal. It is very common for adolescents to forget to give an insulin bolus for meals. When insulin doses are missed, there is a greater chance for poor blood sugar control. When adolescents follow their diabetes plan closely, they have better blood sugar control and overall health.\n\nTwo behavioral economic interventions will be evaluated. COIN2DOSE (Cash-Only INcentive to promote mealtime insulin DOSE Engagement) and LOAN2DOSE (Behavioral Economic concept that uses an economic loss aversion approach to promote insulin dose engagement in adolescents with Type 1 Diabetes). These programs were designed to improve blood sugar control by decreasing the number of missed mealtime boluses. For COIN2DOSE, we will offer the opportunity for youth to earn a bonus reimbursement during which they achieve at least 5 days of 3 mealtime insulin boluses. Finally, we will pay youth up for sharing their insulin use data at least two times per week with the study team during the three-month treatment phase. For LOAN2DOSE, the participants will start with a monetary \"balance\" and will keep it if they bolus as instructed - at least 5 days of 3 mealtime insulin boluses. If they do not do this, their balance will decrease throughout the study."

            "Repetitive blast exposure has been shown to lead to more severe neurobehavioral impairments versus a single exposure. Blast-induced Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) can lead to short- and long-term adverse outcomes Even mild brain injuries can impair neurocognitive performance, and repeated injuries can amplify negative outcomes.\n\nService members with repeated exposure to low-level blasts as a necessary part of their job or training display altered neural activity during a memory task that is paralleled by a reduction in accuracy on neurocognitive memory tasks. As a result, it is important to monitor service members that are exposed to multiple blast-generated mTBIs to allow the earliest identification of acute or chronic brain and body insult and provide individualized measures of time to recovery. While TBI is clinically diagnosable, the methods of diagnosis have up to now been typically expensive and immobile, and treatments and interventions sparse. The investigators will conduct a longitudinal assessment of mTBI brain biomarkers by collecting repeated measures of FDA approved mTBI brain injury biomarkers, correlated with sound and blast exposure, as well as continuous monitoring through smart watches (activity, sleep, biometrics, calorie expenditure, balance) and analyte data through analyte sensors (glucose, lactate, ketones). Study data will be organized into categories and presented to participants daily within the application and will be securely stored within the application. At the completion of the study, participants will be provided with the study data digitally within the mobile application and study data will also be provided to the credentialed unit medical provider to enable it to be ported to the participants' electronic medical record. This study will create a continuous record of blast overpressure and sound exposures and correlate those to the participants health state over the course of several 9-week courses. This will enable an assessment of individualized susceptibility to brain injury as well as providing novel data on time to recovery.

            "The proposed studies will test this hypothesis by randomizing patients with AF to 2-HOBA or placebo 7 days prior to AF ablation to allow 2-HOBA to reach steady-state levels. We hypothesize that tissue injury from AF ablation causes a large release of ROS that react with lipids to generate IsoLGs (Figure 2). In the absence of 2-HOBA, IsoLGs will react within seconds to form IsoLG-macromolecule adducts in atrial tissue, promoting early recurrence of AF. In the presence of 2-HOBA, IsoLGs will rapidly react to form IsoLG-macromolecule adducts in atrial tissue, promoting early recurrence of AF. In the presence of 2-HOBA, IsoLG will preferentially bind to and therefore be inactivated by 2-HOBA thereby sparing injury to the atrial tissue caused by oxidative stress and its contribution to early recurrence of AF. Early recurrence of AF will be measured by ECGs that are recorded once per day by a smartwatch (Apple Watch, Apple Inc., Cupertino, CA) with additional ECGs recorded by the participant if they experience symptoms of AF, or if the smartwatch alerts the participant of a possible AF episode via its auto-detection AF monitoring algorithm. The Apple Watch's AF algorithm is based on sampling of heart rate and variability and will give an audible alarm if those parameters indicate a possible episode of AF. The smartwatch records a single-lead ECG if the participant touches the watch with their contralateral hand. The day and time of the episode is also stored by the smartwatch. At the end of the 28-day follow-up period, study personnel will review the stored ECGs. Blood will be drawn prior to ablation and on post-procedure Day 1 for measurement of IsoLG-adduct levels. DNA will be extracted to explore a pharmacogenomic interaction with haplotypes at the chromosome 4q25 AF risk locus, which: 1) is strongly associated with the development of AF and the early recurrence of AF after ablation27; and 2) has been reported to be a regulator of an anti-oxidant gene program in response to cardiac injury."

Currently, these devices can be used for monitoring and possible early diagnosis of abnormalities in order to prevent health complications and bring about better outcomes, as well as monitor the user's progress and thus prevent more serious developments. Objective: to analyze, in patients with cardiovascular disease, the electrocardiographic aspects detected from the device in comparison to the conventional electrocardiogram, identifying aspects of similarity between the tracings obtained and automatic diagnostic accuracy by the device and by the visual assessment of the tracing. Method: a cross-sectional observational study of diagnostic accuracy will be carried out at the University Hospital of the Federal University of Piaui. The following parameters were considered: significance level of 95%, test power of 80%, value of the disease diagnosis rate of 84%, area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 94% and an equal proportion of the number of positive and negative cases. The minimum sample size consisted of 100 patients, and an additional 10% will be added to compensate for possible losses. A total of 110 patients will be invited to participate in the study. Patients aged \u2265 18 years will be included, with the presence of one or more diagnoses below: systemic arterial hypertension, heart failure, valvular disease, coronary atherosclerotic disease, myocardial infarction, endocarditis, myocarditis, diabetes, cardiac arrhythmias and patients with cardiac pace or implantable automatic defibrillator. The variables analyzed will be: clinical-demographic data of the patients, including age, sex, race, socioeconomic profile; comorbidities and electrocardiographic findings as measured by the clock and conventional ECG. The data will be analyzed comparatively between the groups: 1 = EKG on the clock; 2 = 12-lead conventional EKG and DI (single lead). The primary outcome will be the positive diagnostic correlation of the data obtained in group 1 in relation to group 2. Secondary outcomes: successful measurement of the electrocardiographic record by the clock; diagnostic accuracy of atrial fibrillation and other heart rhythm disorders."

            "The gut microbiome is made up of the microbes (such as bacteria, viruses, and other organisms too small to see with the naked eye) that live in the digestive tract and has been shown to be important in metabolizing food, extracting vitamins and nutrients from food, and maintaining a healthy gut lining. The gut microbiome plays an important role in overall health and has been shown to dynamically change in response to early-stage triple-negative breast cancer-directed therapies, which in turn has been associated with worse outcomes. As the gut microbiome can be further modulated with dietary changes during cancer treatment, it is an ideal potential modifiable risk factor in cancer patients. However, due to multiple confounding factors such as dietary intake, mood, and activity, its utility as part of the oncologic clinical assessment remains unclear.\n\nIn this prospective randomized controlled study, the investigators propose to recruit up to 30 early-stage TNBC patients to randomize to a personalized nutritional intervention of a high-fiber diet coached by a registered dietician versus educational handout alone during neoadjuvant treatment. The investigators propose to study the gut microbiota through stool sample analysis among early-stage triple-negative breast cancer patients undergoing neoadjuvant (i.e. before surgery) chemotherapy +/- immunotherapy. The investigators will also study how the gut microbiota can be further modulated with a high-fiber diet, and the investigators hypothesize that a high-fiber diet may play a protective role in preserving gut microbial diversity. As part of the nutritional intervention, the investigators propose to administer nutritional counseling with a registered dietitian (RD) to increase fiber intake and tracking performance status, activity, and mood during neoadjuvant treatment. Finally, the investigators propose to survey participants after study completion through one-on-one interviews to determine whether participants experienced improved overall patient satisfaction in supportive care during their treatment."

One of the most common cardiologic diseases at the age of 18-30 is benign heart rhythm disorder, which often does not require diagnosis or treatment and can be considered normal.\n\nThat said, notification of the detection of atrial fibrillation can affect psycho-emotional well-being, particularly anxiety.\n\nThis study will assess the level of psycho-emotional health (anxiety level) of the study participants. Participant observation will provide an opportunity to identify associations between the use of the ECG recording function on wearable devices and levels of anxiety and depression. It is hypothesized that the use of smartwatches with the ECG function activated will not lead to a change in anxiety levels on the GAD-7 scale among the study participants. This assumes that after 30 days of use, the mean value of the GAD-7 scale in the intervention group and the control group will be the same."

            "Medications with sedative or anticholinergic effects such as antidepressants, benzodiazepines, or opioids have been associated with impaired cognitive and physical function. They are referred to as potentially inappropriate medications or medications that are best avoided by older adults. The accumulated evidence has now shifted the clinical and research focus to evaluating the who, what, and how of the best way to deprescribe (i.e., dose reduction or cessation of these medications). The Drug Burden Index (DBI) allows researchers and clinicians to quantify the cumulative burden of anticholinergic and sedative medications in each patient. Deprescribing these medications is a complex health intervention based on trade-offs between their clinical benefits (e.g., symptom management and prevention of diseases) and their adverse drug events to improve physical and cognitive function. Existing physical function performance metrics, such as gait speed captured in the clinic, are often non-specific and do not reflect real-life performance. Innovative mobility metrics are required to better understand specific deficits with age and disease and the effects of medications on these deficits.\n\nThe goal of this project is to better characterize the impact of reducing the anticholinergic and sedative medication burden on physical function in older adults by novel mobility metrics in lab and real-life environments.\n\nA prospective, longitudinal cohort of 182 community-dwelling older adults (\u2265 65 years) with a DBI of \u2265 1 will be completed. Using a quasi-experimental design, recruited patients will undergo a medication deprescribing plan, as part of usual clinical care, that includes three gradual changes to their medication regimen resulting in three DBI levels. At each DBI level, physical function mobility including dual-task tests) will be assessed in the lab with wearable sensors during validated clinical tests such as the Short Physical Performance Battery. Objective balance and mobility metrics (e.g., sway area and frequency, stride length) will be extracted. Physical function will also be assessed continuously in the patient's real-life environment from recruitment to the last lab visit, using wearable (Apple Watch\u00ae with ankle inertial measurement unit) and environmental sensors.

            "Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common arrhythmia affecting 1.3 million people in the UK. AF causes an irregular and fast heartbeat, which makes the heart pump poorly. As a result, blood clots may form inside the heart and, if they travel to the brain, can lead to an AF-related stroke. Patients with AF have a risk of stroke five-times higher than patients with normal rhythm.\n\nAnticoagulants make the blood less likely to clot and, thus, reduce the chances of an AF-related stroke. For most people, once anticoagulation is started it must be taken for the rest of their lives irrespective of the amount of AF someone has. However, anticoagulants make patients more prone to bleeding.\n\nNew studies have reported a lower stroke risk in patients with short and infrequent AF episodes. If there are long time gaps in between AF episodes, short periods of anticoagulation around the time of AF may be enough to avoid clots from forming and reducing the overall risk of bleeding. To use anticoagulants only when needed will require an accurate and reliable way to detect AF when it occurs and alert patients. New technologies, such as small heart monitors placed under the skin, watches and rings, can track the heart rhythm continuously and send real-time alerts to patients via mobile phone message if AF is detected.\n\nThe purpose of this study is to investigate if implantable cardiac monitors (LINQ II) and wearable devices (Apple Watch and CART-I ring) can detect AF episodes, send real-time alerts to patients and who will respond to these alerts within a short timeframe. The investigators will recruit 50 patients and follow them for six months. All participants will receive a LINQ II and a wearable device."

A pilot trial will be conducted in participants who are overweight (BMI 25-29.9 kg/m2) and a separate group of participants who consume a low quality diet (low in fruit and vegetable intake) and/or have a nutrition deficiency (specifically iron-deficiency anaemia).\n\nDuring this study the subjects will be asked to attend the lab (or remotely due to covid restrictions) at the beginning of the study for baseline measurements and instructions on how to use / download the mobile application. Participants will have their anthropometrics measured (including height/ weight/ waist: hip circumference). The PROTEIN application will collect self-reported data from the user, which includes: user profile input, dietary and fluid intake, daily physical activity (such as step count), biochemistry, sleep and chewing (in- meal behaviour). Information on how users will interact with the app, which screens they use, how many log ons and how often data is inputted will also be collected. Throughout the trial, the participants will be contacted via the application or by the researchers to request feedback on their progress and to encourage reporting of any issues.\n\nHealth care professionals will also be recruited to test the expert dashboard of the PROTEIN app. Through this system they will be able to provide nutrition/ physical activity advice directly to their patients and input their relevant biochemical results (such as haemoglobin for anaemic patients)."

            "Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common arrhythmia (irregular heart rhythm), affecting 1-2 million people in the UK. AF significantly increases the risk of an AF-related stroke, heart failure and dementia. A significant proportion of people will have no symptoms, and they may only be found to have AF after suffering an AF-related stroke.\n\nAn electrocardiogram (ECG) uses sensors placed on the skin to record the heart's electrical activity. A 12-lead ECG uses 10 sensors and is the gold-standard (best available test) to detect any abnormal heart rhythm disturbances. Until recently, a 12-lead ECG showing an irregular heart rhythm was required to make a diagnosis of AF but as AF episodes are often short and unpredictable it may be missed. Therefore, a small device that continuously records heartbeat and heart rhythm could make the diagnosis of arrhythmias and AF much quicker and easier.\n\nAccessories such as watches or rings - referred to as wearable devices - have extremely good sensors that measure pulse rate by detecting small changes in skin colour during each heartbeat and can perform a single-lead ECG. Algorithms built in the wearable devices can identify irregular heart rhythms, such as atrial fibrillation.\n\nThe purpose of this study is to test two new wearable devices - the Skylabs CART-I ring and the Apple Watch - in detecting abnormal heart rhythm recording and recording ECGs. The investigators plan to recruit 500 patients attending Cardiology Departments in several hospitals in the UK and will ask them to wear the Apple Watch and the CART-I and perform 12-lead ECG with each device (two in total). No extra follow-up visits are required. At the end of the study, the investigators will compare interpretation by two cardiologists of the wearable devices' ECGs and the 12-lead ECGs and look at their ability to automatically detect abnormal rhythms."

Nursery or school carers may also be trained if needed. During the closed loop arm, subjects use the system for 16 weeks under free-living conditions at home and in nursery/school without remote monitoring.

Secondary outcomes include the time spent with glucose levels above and below target and other CGM metrics. Safety assessments include the frequency and severity of hypoglycaemic episodes and diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). In the extension phase, participants have follow-up contacts every 3 months, with the primary endpoint measured over 18 months from the end of the primary phase and compared to sensor augmented pump therapy during that phase.

Patients who receive steroid injections for conditions like back pain or arthritis experience temporary high blood sugar (called steroid-induced hyperglycemia, SIH), which can sometimes lead to complications, especially in patients with diabetes. This study aims to understand this by monitoring blood glucose levels using continuous glucose monitors (Dexcom G7).

            "Type 1 diabetes (T1D) affects around 200,000 people in France. The only treatment is insulin, administered either by multiple injections, by pump alone or, more recently, by automated insulin delivery systems (AIDs), which have resulted in a very significant improvement in glycaemic control and quality of life. These closed-loop (CL) devices are capable of effectively regulating the conventional factors associated with glycaemic disturbance, namely dietary intake and physical activity. However, they do not account of stress, which some subjects with T1D perceive as a major disrupter of their blood sugar levels. One of the reasons for this is undoubtedly that stress, unlike diet or physical activity, cannot be anticipated. Since stress is difficult to predict, it is also more difficult to study. Its onset, intensity, duration and progression are linked to the subject's experience, psychological state and environment. Not all patients respond to stress triggers in the same way. Some patients appear to be more reactive than others to these agents, particularly when they are exposed to them chronically or repeatedly, in an anxiety-provoking environment. This is known as chronic psychosocial stress, and it is this type of stress that seems to be most closely associated with glycaemic disturbance in subjects with T1D, most often in the form of hyperglycaemia and, more rarely, hypoglycaemia. However, there are no solid epidemiological or experimental data to support these observations.\n\nThe study we propose is a prospective multicentre clinical trial in 125 subjects with T1D treated with insulin pumps or multi-injections at 14 French university centres. Our aim is to evaluate the relationship between interstitial glucose levels measured by CGM and perceived stress, assessed 4 times a day, away from mealtimes in order to avoid the impact of dietary glycaemia, using a \"stressometer\". This stressometer is an application designed by CERITD that can be downloaded to the patient's smartphone and consists of an electronic visual analogue scale (VAS) on which the level of stress felt is evaluated quantitatively (continuous value between 0 and 10)."

Due to the demands of day-to-day life, pre-bolusing is not always possible or may be forgotten. With continuous glucose monitors (CGMs), PwT1D may be alerted to this missed insulin dose by a CGM alert, including rapidly rising glucose (change \\>2.5mmol/L/15min) or hyperglycemia (\\>10.0 mmol/L), and deliver a mistimed (post-prandial) dose in response to CGM alert.\n\nThis study was designed to determine the effect of combining a post-prandial/mistimed insulin dose with 15 minutes of brisk walking.

            "Powerful new drugs that can prevent or delay end stage kidney disease (ESKD) - so called sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) - are now available for patients with type 2 diabetes. Whether these drugs have similar effects in patients with type 1 diabetes (T1D) remains unknown because of the few studies in this population, due to concerns about the increase in risk of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA, a serious, potentially fatal acute complication of diabetes due to the accumulation of substances called ketone bodies) observed with SGLT2i therapy in T1D. One of the few T1D studies conducted to date showed that implementing an enhanced DKA prevention plan can reduce the risk of DKA associated with the SGLT2i sotagliflozin (SOTA) to very low levels. In the present study, a similar DKA prevention program will be used to carry-out a 3-year trial to test the kidney benefit of SOTA in 150 persons with T1D and moderate to advanced DKD. After a 2-month period, during which diabetes care will be standardized and education on monitoring and minimizing DKA implemented, eligible study subjects will be randomly assigned (50/50) to take one tablet of SOTA (200 mg) or a similarly looking inactive tablet (placebo) every day for 3 years followed by 2-months without treatment. Neither the participants nor the study staff will know whether a person was assigned to taking SOTA or the inactive tablet. Kidney function at the end of the study will be compared between the two treatment groups to see whether SOTA prevented kidney function loss in those treated with this drug as compared to those who took the inactive tablet. The DKA prevention program will include participant education, close follow-up with study staff, continuous glucose monitoring, and systematic ketone body self-monitoring with a meter provided by the study. If successful, this study will provide efficacy and safety data that could be used to seek FDA approval of SOTA for the prevention of kidney function decline in patients with T1D and DKD."

            "Diabetes is a common long-term health condition globally. Type 1 diabetes requires insulin treatment right from diagnosis. Similarly, many living with type 2 diabetes eventually require insulin injections as the condition progresses. A common but often underappreciated complication associated with insulin use is the formation of fatty tissue at injection sites, known as \"Lipos,\" a shorthand for \"Lipohypertrophy.\" These Lipos can interfere with insulin absorption, leading to an altered insulin action profile. This results in glucose fluctuations increasing the risk of both high and low glucose levels.\n\nIn current medical practice, Lipos are assessed through clinical examination, specifically by physically palpating the injection sites. Research indicates that approximately 40% of insulin-treated individuals may have Lipos. However, manual palpation can often overlook these fatty deposits. Ultrasound scanning (USS) presents a more effective method for detecting Lipos. Studies that have employed ultrasound scanning have reported a much higher prevalence, reaching up to 86%.\n\nThe primary goal of this study is to ascertain whether the avoidance of ultrasound-identified Lipos can improve glucose regulation. The focus will be on individuals using continuous glucose monitoring who exhibit high glucose fluctuations and less time within their target range. By focusing on this population, the chances of identifying those with Lipos will increase.\n\nParticipants will undergo a clinical examination followed by an ultrasound scan. Those found to have Lipos will receive guidance on avoiding those sites and education on insulin injection techniques. Glucose data will be collected periodically over the next 24 weeks. After this period, participants will return for a follow-up ultrasound scan. Additionally, members of the diabetes care team will be trained to conduct the ultrasound scans. Data from this study may also be utilized to develop artificial intelligence algorithms aimed at identifying Lipos in future ultrasound scans."

            "Type 1 Diabetes (T1D) is a serious disease that happens because the body cannot control blood glucose (sugar) levels. People with T1D need insulin shots because their body does not make insulin. Insulin lowers blood sugar levels. When blood sugar levels are too high or too low it causes medical problems.\n\nYouth with T1D can really impact their own health if they follow their T1D treatment plan. However, even with the help of doctors, nurses, and family, most adolescents find it hard to follow their diabetes plan close enough to meet their A1C goal. It is very common for adolescents to forget to give an insulin bolus for meals. When insulin doses are missed, there is a greater chance for poor blood sugar control. When adolescents follow their diabetes plan closely, they have better blood sugar control and overall health.\n\nTwo behavioral economic interventions will be evaluated. COIN2DOSE (Cash-Only INcentive to promote mealtime insulin DOSE Engagement) and LOAN2DOSE (Behavioral Economic concept that uses an economic loss aversion approach to promote insulin dose engagement in adolescents with Type 1 Diabetes). These programs were designed to improve blood sugar control by decreasing the number of missed mealtime boluses. For COIN2DOSE, we will offer the opportunity for youth to earn a bonus reimbursement during which they achieve at least 5 days of 3 mealtime insulin boluses. Finally, we will pay youth up for sharing their insulin use data at least two times per week with the study team during the three-month treatment phase. For LOAN2DOSE, the participants will start with a monetary \"balance\" and will keep it if they bolus as instructed - at least 5 days of 3 mealtime insulin boluses. If they do not do this, their balance will decrease throughout the study."

In particular, they have higher rates of diabetes-related complications and other related conditions such as myocardial infarction, cerebrovascular disease, kidney failure, blindness, neuropathy, and the risk of amputation. Diabetes affects 34 million adults in the US. Achieving a target HbA1c less than 8% can be challenging through diabetes management. Patients are able to monitor their blood glucose levels with devices such as blood glucose meters or continuous glucose monitors to facilitate diabetes management and glycemic control. Past studies have demonstrated that these devices are effective in engaging patients in the improvement of diabetes management. Current advancements in remote patient monitoring and self-monitoring have been observed to be effective in facilitating improvement in diabetes outcomes. However, the effectiveness and financial feasibility of these devices delivered in conjunction with automated patient engagement systems in remote patient monitoring programs is not well understood among underinsured, underserved, and vulnerable minority populations as they face a high-cost barrier particularly with continuous glucose monitors. To better address this gap in knowledge, this pilot study will compare and examine the effectiveness of these interventions on patient outcomes with Type 2 diabetes among populations in the West Side of Chicago. Study the comparative effectiveness among patients with uncontrolled Type 2 diabetes on insulin in an intervention group using remote patient monitoring and automated patient engagement system with blood glucose monitors to a group using a self-monitoring program with continuous glucose monitors and a usual care group receiving standard care.

Achieving glycemic targets is associated with reduced risk for both micro-and macrovascular complications, better neurocognitive function, and better diabetes quality of life. In lab studies, sleep deprivation led to impaired glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity in adults without chronic condition and in one study of adults with T1D. Extending sleep in natural environments contributes to improved insulin sensitivity and glucose levels, neurocognition, and psychological symptoms in young adults without chronic conditions. Modifiable dimensions of sleep health (appropriate sleep duration, stability, and timing) are associated with better glycemic control in adults with T1D. Therefore, improving sleep duration, stability, and timing may be potential therapeutic targets to improve glucoregulation and clinical outcomes (diabetes self-management, neurocognitive function, and symptoms) in this high-risk population.\n\nThe overall objective is to test and compare the effects of a cognitive-behavioral sleep self-management intervention (sleep extension and consistency in sleep timing) compared to an attention control condition (habitual sleep duration + diabetes self-management education) on improving sleep duration, stability, and timing, and glycemia (glycemic control and glucose variability) in short-sleeping young adults with T1D in a pilot randomized controlled trial."

            "The detection of and control of gestational diabetes carries benefits for both mother and baby related to immediate pregnancy outcomes. The glycemic disorders in diabetes are not solely limited to fasting and postprandial hyperglycemia, but can be extended to the glycemic variability that includes both upward (postprandial glucose increments) and downward (interprandial glucose decrements) changes. Glycemic variability, as a component of the glycemic disorders, has more deleterious effects than sustained chronic hyperglycemia in the development of diabetic complications. Glycemic variability is associated with increased risks of adverse pregnancy outcomes in GDM. Hyperglycemic excursion has been shown to be the strongest predictor of macrosomia, the most common complication of pregnancy with diabetes. When compared with routine standard antenatal care, continuous glucose monitoring system (CGMS) guided treatments should signi\ufb01cantly improve glycemic control, lower infant birth weight, and reduce risk of macrosomia in gestational women with diabetes. We will investigate the following questions (1) Whether CGMS can detect greater glycemic variability in women with an early GDM diagnosis; (2) Whether CGMS can subsequently moderate treatment strategies of GDM especially patient behavior and glucose levels; (3) Whether CGMS can eventually improve maternal (i.e., reduce gestational weight gain and lower glycemic levels during pregnancy) and fetal outcomes (reduce LGA babies and C-section rate) compared with traditional self-monitored blood glucose (SMBG) use."

Beyond the nutritional aspects, the relationship to food and the resulting eating behaviors can be a source of suffering. Also, it has been reported that one out of two people over 60 years of age living with type 1 diabetes has cognitive impairment. Changes in cognitive functions can have important implications for daily well-being, diet (e.g., the ability to modulate cravings), and treatment decisions to manage diabetes.\n\nOne factor that can affect both eating behaviors and cognitive function is variation in blood glucose levels.\n\nThis research aims to better understand the impact of glycemic variability in disordered eating behaviors and cognitive impairment, and its consequences on self-management skills in people with type 1 diabetes.\n\nThe hypotheses are that i) higher glycemic variability is associated with higher disordered eating behaviors and poorer cognitive function in people with type 1 diabetes, and that differences exist between sexes, ii) higher disordered eating behaviors and poorer cognitive function are associated with lower self-management skills; and iii) cognitive impairment, interoception awareness and insulin resistance may mediate the relationship between glycemic variability and disordered eating behaviors.\n\nThis research study will contribute to highlighting the consequences of blood sugar fluctuations, \"sugar swings\", in daily life, in particular the way they disrupt eating behaviors and brain function.

            "There is a fundamental gap in understanding the maternal and neonatal effects of antenatal corticosteroid (ACS) administration in women with threatened preterm birth (PTB) who have diabetes. Since the initial discovery of ACS for neonatal benefit in 1972, more than 40 randomized controlled trials have been performed evaluating its efficacy. However, none of these trials have included women with T2DM, and there is limited data among women with gestational diabetes. While ACS have been shown to reduce neonatal morbidity associated with PTB in non-diabetic women, the side effects of ACS (maternal hyperglycemia and fetal hyperinsulinemia) may mitigate the neonatal benefit of ACS in women with diabetes. Before neonatal benefit of ACS can be evaluated in this population, the first step is to optimize maternal glycemic control after ACS. Previous studies evaluating maternal hyperglycemia after ACS have been limited by small sample size, retrospective study design, or insufficient glucose data. Use of continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) in a randomized clinical trial provides a unique opportunity to overcome these challenges. Our long-term goal is to improve maternal and child health among women with diabetes as an independently funded clinical researcher. The research objectives of this proposal are to test the efficacy of three treatment strategies at achieving maternal glycemic control after ACS and evaluate the association between maternal glycemic control and neonatal outcomes. Our central hypothesis is that treatment with a continuous insulin infusion will improve maternal glycemic control, which is key to improving neonatal outcomes, but at the cost of less patient satisfaction and more health resource utilization. This hypothesis will be tested by pursuing the following specific aims: 1) Test the efficacy of three treatment strategies (addition of sliding scale insulin, up-titration of home insulin, and continuous insulin infusion) at achieving maternal glycemic control after ACS and 2) Quantify the association between maternal glycemic control after ACS and neonatal morbidity. Completion of these aims will determine the optimal strategy to achieve maternal glycemic control after ACS and inform a larger, multicenter trial to improve neonatal outcomes among women with diabetes and threatened PTB."

Advancements in traditional methods of dietary assessment (i.e., web-based dietary recalls or records) have aimed at improving data accuracy while reducing participant burden. Further utilizing food recognition technologies to capture real-time food intake may aid in overcoming limitations of existing methods. Keenoa, an artificial intelligence-enhanced, image-assisted tool, is a newly designed mobile application that may facilitate collection of dietary data.\n\nPrimarily, the investigators will assess acceptability and usability of Keenoa compared with the traditional, web-based Automatic Self-Administered 24-Hour (ASA24) Dietary Assessment Tool in the Framingham Heart Study Third Generation-based cohorts at examination 4. The investigators will also determine the proportion of participants who complete all three days of dietary assessment, either through Keenoa or ASA24. Further, the investigators will relate dietary determinants of glycemic variability (e.g., percent carbohydrate, fiber intake, etc.), obtained from each dietary assessment tool, to the continuous glucose monitor (CGM)-derived outcomes.\n\nWith a randomized block design, this study will take place as part of the Framingham Heart Study (FHS) glucose study (R01 DK129305). Currently participants from the Third Generation-based cohorts are asked at their fourth examination to wear Dexcom G6 Pro continuous glucose monitor on either their arm or abdomen for a duration of at least 4 days. During this time, participants are asked to complete 3 consecutive days of dietary record through ASA24. For this trial, the investigators will randomize the dietary assessment tool weekly between ASA24 and Keenoa, therefore, depending on the week of administration, participants will be randomized to either a 3 days dietary record via ASA24 or a 3-day dietary record through Keenoa. This trial will last a total of 6 weeks."

In the last 10 years, the focus has largely been on technology, and the introduction of automated insulin delivery (AID) systems has revolutionized the treatment of type 1 diabetes. AID is an automated system that works by enabling the insulin pump and continuous glucose monitor (CGM) to communicate with each other, automatically adjusting the subcutaneous insulin dosage according to blood glucose levels. AID technology is predominantly used for individuals with long duration of type 1 diabetes, and due to economic limitations in access to the treatment, it is especially used for those with treatment-related challenges in diabetes regulation. The aim of the Steno Free trials is to investigate whether AID technology combined with on-demand consultations for adults with newly diagnosed type 1 diabetes, compared to conventional standard treatment with a CGM after 1 year of treatment, leads to:\n\n1. less diabetes distress, improved quality of life, and increased health literacy,\n2. better diabetes regulation,\n3. less disease burden and, therefore, a greater degree of freedom in their daily lives."

The proposed research leverages a recently funded proposal by the USDA to study in greater depth inflammation, glucoregulation and oxidative stress defense and their relation to improving endothelial function and insulin sensitivity.\n\nBefore and after strawberry intake, blood samples will be collected for monocyte (immune cells and source of inflammatory cytokines) isolation and activation via changes in cellular NF-\u03baB and Nrf-2 (key transcription factors of inflammation/oxidative stress defense) status along with products of their activation (ie., plasma cytokines). Because inflammation and oxidative stress impairs endothelial function and insulin sensitivity, acutely and chronically, investigators will also study changes in vascular and insulin sensitivity status, assessing changes in vascular adhesion molecules, endothelial responsiveness through flow mediated vasodilation (ie., FMD) and insulin sensitivity using the Liquid Meal Tolerance (LMTT) if intravenous glucose tolerance test (IVGTT) method cannot be used due to supply chain issues of sterile Dextrose. Glucoregulation will be assessed by placing a Continuous Glucose monitoring (CGM) machine (Dexcom-6) to participants for 10 days at the beginning and at the end of the study period of intervention. The study will be a randomized, double-blinded, 3-arm parallel, 4-week, dose-response study.

The survival rate has increased significantly during the last decades as a consequence of more intensive chemotherapy. This very toxic treatment results in severe acute toxicities and late effects, which is the biggest challenge today besides survival. The overall purpose of contemporary ALL treatment is to reduce the toxic treatment without compromising the excellent survival rates of these diseases. This study is a part of this. The researchers want to investigate the incidence of glucose intolerance and medicine induced diabetes during treatment for ALL and lymphoma with steroids (prednisolone or dexamethasone) and \u00b1 PEG-asparaginase.\n\nSteroids and asparaginase are used in the treatment of ALL and lymphomas, and both drugs may induce glucose intolerance or diabetes, especially when they are given concomitantly. The incidence and duration of increased blood glucose levels are not very well investigated, and especially not monitored continuously during treatment phases with steroids and +/- asparaginase, as the investigators want to do in this study.\n\nIn the study the participants must have a glucose sensor attached under the skin, which continuously measures blood glucose during treatment. Moreover, blood samples are drawn several times to measure insulin sensitivity and beta cell function.\n\nThe participants are children and adolescents (1.0-17.9 years) with newly diagnosed ALL or lymphoma treated at one of the four Danish pediatric oncology sites.\n\nBlood glucose levels are followed during treatment with steroids and PEG-asparaginase in these patient groups. The results may give rise to a new treatment guidelines for measuring and treating blood glucose in these patients.

At-risk newborns (infants of diabetic mothers \\[IDM\\], large \\[LGA\\] and small \\[SGA\\] for gestational age infants, and late preterm \\[LPT\\] infants) undergo a hypoglycemia screening protocol that involves numerous intermittent needle sticks to test glucose levels on bedside glucometers; however, continuous glucose monitoring (CGM, currently not approved for clinical use in babies), via a small sensor placed in the thigh (only 1 needle stick), would likely decrease pain while providing continuous glucose levels. This study will evaluate the feasibility, safety, and precision of CGM in at-risk newborns, and determine if this method would decrease the amount of painful procedures and episodes of hypoglycemia missed by intermittent sampling.\n\nAs part of regular medical care, participants will undergo intermittent blood glucose screening with heel sticks as per the current hospital standard of care protocol. Regular medical care involves checking the participant's blood glucose via heel stick every few hours using a bedside glucometer, with another heel stick to confirm low values in the laboratory. If the participant has low values, he/she may be treated with oral glucose gel, feedings of breast milk or formula, or intravenous (IV) fluids in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU). This research study involves placing a CGM device in addition to undergoing the current blood glucose screening protocol and treatment.\n\nAs soon as possible after birth, a continuous glucose monitoring device (Dexcom G7) will be placed on the participant's thigh by a research team member, and will blindly continuously record glucose levels that will be analyzed after discharge. Everyone who agrees to participate in this study will have placement of this experimental device.\n\nThe investigational device will stay in place for the same amount of time that a participant is undergoing blood glucose monitoring as per the current standard of care protocol, for a maximum of 7 days. A participant may need to have his/her blood glucose checked after 7 days for regular medical care (and not for research), because his/her glucose concentrations are still low.

Secondary objectives aim to evaluate the effect of tablet semaglutide on renal graft function, weight, use of insulin, cardiovascular parameters and safety parameters (plasma semaglutide concentration, gastrointestinal side effects, dose of immunosuppressants).\n\nDesign: An investigator-initiated, placebo-controlled, double-blinded, parallel-group, randomised trial.\n\nPopulation: Patients (n = 104) with post-transplant hyperglycaemia and an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) \\> 15 ml/min/1.73 m2.\n\nMethods: Participants diagnosed with post-transplant hyperglycaemia, 10 to 15 days post-transplant, will be randomised 1:1 to either 14 weeks of tablet semaglutide once daily or placebo both as add-on to standard glucose-lowering therapy. Participants will maintain weekly contact with the clinic during the first five weeks and at two to four weeks intervals during the remaining study period. During the trial, each patient will be monitored according to blood laboratory values with safety assessed at every visit by a nephrologist. Pre-prandial plasma glucose will be measured in the morning and evening to adjust glucose-lowering therapy after consultation with an endocrinologist. Double blinded continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) will be performed for 10-14 days from baseline and at weeks 5, 9, and 13.\n\nPrimary endpoint:\n\n- Mean sensor glucose (mmol/L) evaluated by CGM\n\nKey secondary endpoints:\n\n* Incidence of hypoglycaemia\n* Body weight (kg)\n* Creatinine (\u03bcmol/L)\n* Daily insulin dose (IE per day)\n* Plasma concentration of semaglutide (nmol/L)\n* Blood concentrations of cyclosporine and tacrolimus (\u03bcg/L)"

            "More than half of all new cases of type 1 diabetes (T1D) are diagnosed in the first decade of life. It has been reported that early onset T1D may be associated with deterioration in cognitive performance. It mainly affects working memory or the ability to perform complex tasks involving planning (executive functions) or decision-making. Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has reported alteration brain growth alteration related to impaired cognitive performance. Exposure to hypoglycemia, hyperglycemia and glycemic variability are thought to be responsible for these structural changes, especially in younger patients. Those changes can be detected early after diagnosis. Automatized insulin delivery systems (AIDS) can dramatically improve glycemic profile in children with T1D by reducing the occurrence of hypo and hyperglycemia. However, in France, market authorization are limited to children with unbalanced T1D who have failed to respond to other therapies and to the reinforcement of diabetes education. It therefore does not concern newly diagnosed patients. 60% of patients under 10 diagnosed with T1DM for less than 3 years are not treated in France by these systems. The aim of this study is therefore to determine whether early treatment of patients with AIDS would have a positive impact on cerebral growth and and on cognitive function in pediatric patients with T1DM."

In case of confirmed dysglycemia, we propose to perform CGM and OGTT every 3 months.\n\nThe main questions the study aims to answer are:\n\n1. Do the amplitude and time trends of CGM-derived glycemic variability indices and OGTT- and clamp-derived variables differ between the intermediate, high and very high risk groups?\n2. Can (changes in) CGM-derived glycemic variability indices predict/detect dysglycemia in initially normoglycemic (single or multiple autoantibody-positive) relatives with the same diagnostic efficiency as OGTT- or clamp-derived variables?\n3.

            "Only 24.9% of the Belgian adults (25-50 years) with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) achieve a good glucose control. This can be explained by the challenging day-to-day diabetes management which places a substantial burden on this population. However, a tight glycemic control is fundamental in order to prevent the development of acute and chronic complications. Despite the added value of continue glucose monitors to glucose control, optimizing daily glucose levels is still problematic in adults with T1DM. In addition to self-monitoring of blood glucose, a healthy lifestyle with sufficient physical activity (PA), limited sedentary behavior (SB) and sufficient sleep time and quality is crucial for a good glucose control. A recent shift in health promotion stresses the importance of considering all these behaviors (i.e. PA, SB and sleep) in one 24-hour day instead of focusing on one behavior in isolation. The aim of this study is to investigate the association between the day-by-day 24h-MB patterns of adults (25-50 years) with T1DM and their intra-day glucose control (i.e. time in range and coefficient of variation) on the one hand. On the other hand, associations between he 24-h MB patterns and explanatory variables and cardiometabolic health markers will be investigated. To gain insight into the 24-hour behavior of adults with type 1 diabetes, 150 adults with type 1 diabetes will wear an Actigraph accelerometer, for 14 consecutive days. Daily glucose control will be measured using the participant's continuous glucose meter. Information about the explanatory variables and cardiometabolic health will be obtained by means of a questionnaire, diary and a few measurements (blood pressure, weight, length, Advanced Glycation Endproducts, hip-and waist circumference) during a one-off visit to one of the recruitment- and testing centers namely University hospital of Ghent or University hospital of Antwerp. The results of this cross-sectional study will inform future interventions focusing on the 24-hour movement behaviors in adults with T1DM."

            "The purpose of this study is to gather feedback on a new continuous glucose monitor (CGM), called DEXCOM One. Unlike some other CGMs which allow a low (hypoglycaemic) and a high (hyperglycaemic) glucose alarm to be set, the DEXCOM One sensor has the unique feature of the 'Sustained Hyperglycaemic Alert', where the alarm is only activated if the glucose is above a certain threshold for a pre-specified amount of time.\n\nInternational consensus guidance states that people with diabetes should aim for 70% time in the range 3.9-10 mmol/L. After meals there is usually a rise in blood glucose, so it is not unexpected for the glucose to go above 10 mmol/L for a short time even if the insulin dose already given before a meal is correct. Therefore, people with a high glucose alarm set at 10 mmol/L on their GCM may unnecessarily inject extra insulin and risk a low blood glucose. However, DEXCOM One's Sustained Hyperglycaemic Alert would only notify patients if their blood sugar was high for a prolonged period, and so may reflect a time when it would be genuinely advantageous to inject more insulin.\n\nThe aim of this single-centre, non-randomised, observational study is to gather experience from a range of users to assess the utility of this unique attribute, and the optimal settings. We aim to recruit 80-100 patients, and each participant's involvement is in 2 phases\u037e for the first 3 months DEXCOM One sensors will be used, and for months 4-6 there will be the option of continuing to use the DEXCOM One sensors with the addition of a FitBit to track physical activity."

Heart failure is a leading cause of death in DMD, but substantial knowledge gaps exist regarding predisposing risk factors. In the general population, hyperglycemia, insulin resistance, and decreased heart rate variability (HRV; reflecting autonomic dysfunction) are associated with cardiomyopathy (CM). It is unclear whether these factors are associated with DMD-CM. Closing this knowledge gap may lead to novel screening and therapeutic strategies to delay progression of DMD-CM, now the leading cause of death in patients with DMD. Despite risk factors for hyperglycemia, including the use of glucocorticoids (GCs), sarcopenia, obesity, and reduced ambulation, little is known regarding glucose abnormalities in DMD. Some of these same risk factors, along with the distance needed to travel for specialty care, present significant barriers to research participation and clinical care for individuals with DMD. Remote wearable technology may improve research participation in this vulnerable population. Therefore, this study will leverage remote wearable technologies to overcome these barriers and define the relationship between dysglycemia and DMD-CM.\n\nThe goal of this remote study is to evaluate rates of hyperglycemia in individuals with DMD compared to control participants using continuous glucose monitors, and to determine the relationship between hyperglycemia and heart rate variability. Participants will utilize continuous glucose monitors, cardiac monitors, and activity monitors to evaluate glucose levels, heart rate, activity, and sleep."

Following a 5 minute data collection and analysis, the algorithm learns and suggests pump-setting changes for optimization of glucose control. The algorithm is designed as an advisory tool for health care professionals and has three main components: First, data analysis report - a statistical analysis of the insulin pump and sensor data: insulin delivery, bolus-calculator rate of use, sensor glucose variables, hypoglycemic and hyperglycemic patterns. Second, recommendations, alert messages based on aforementioned data for example \"pay attention- you skipped boluses\", basal/bolus ratio is too high, bolus delivery compliance, glucose target recommendations and more. Third, a recommendation for new insulin pump settings: including basal intervals and rate, different carbohydrate ratio according to time of day, correction factor and insulin sensitivity time. The Advisor Pro can be used to optimize insulin pump setting during clinical visits, in-between visits or as part of virtual (telemedicine) visit. The objective of the proposed study is to evaluate the use of Advisor Pro by Health Care Providers for regular clinical visits and in between visits titration for adjustment of insulin pump settings.

            "Inpatient management of glycemia in people with diabetes has been inadequately studied. Previous randomized trials of intensive insulin therapy in the hospital setting resulted in excessive hypoglycemia. Current ADA guidelines (glucose 140-180 mg/dL) are by consensus with the upper bound defined by observational data and the lower bound by safety concerns. None of the previous studies of intensive glucose management used CGM technology. Whether near normal glucose levels can be achieved without increasing hypoglycemia among hospitalized patients with diabetes with the advent of CGM technology is not known.\n\nThere are clear associations between hyperglycemia and poor outcomes in patients with diabetes hospitalized with infection, including COVID-19. The COVID-19 pandemic has increased the urgency to definitively answer the question of whether glucose lowering below 140-180 mg/dL can be achieved without increasing hypoglycemia.\n\nIf this proposed study demonstrates intensive management of glucose to a target of 90 to 130 mg/dL without hypoglycemia is achievable in the inpatient setting with CGM technology, a larger study could then be performed to evaluate whether there is clinical benefit including a reduction in morbidity and mortality.\n\nThe primary study hypothesis is that glucose management with CGM can achieve a mean glucose of 90-130 mg/dL without increasing hypoglycemia compared with standard care with a glucose target of 140-180 mg/dL. Individuals with diabetes who are hospitalized (non-ICU) for an eligible condition will be randomly assigned to receive standard therapy (glucose target 140-180 mg/dL per ADA guidelines) or intensive therapy (glucose target 90-130 mg/dL and CGM used for monitoring). Real-time CGM will be used in the Intensive Target Group and masked CGM will be used in the Standard Target Group.\n\nThe co-primary outcomes, assessed via a hierarchical approach, include a treatment group comparison of mean glucose (superiority) followed by a non-inferiority comparison of time \\<54 mg/dL measured with CGM."

            "Overweight and obesity are increasingly prevalent worldwide. These bodyweight disorders are closely related to deficiencies in the control of food intake. A potential yet unexplored mechanism to explain the loss of eating control is the interaction between the gut microbiota and the brain. The mechanisms underlying the communication between the gut microbiome and the host remain largely unexplored. These mechanisms could occur in part through small non-coding RNAs, called microRNAs (miRNAs). miRNAs regulate epigenetic mechanisms to control gene expression.\n\nTwo hypotheses have been proposed:\n\nI. The interaction between the gut microbiota and the brain and its associated epigenetic changes play an important role in the overweight-related loss of eating control and metabolic imbalance.\n\nII.The composition and functionality of the gut microbiota are associated with circulating microRNAs and glycemic variability and modify the effect of physical activity on cognitive parameters and brain microstructure (R2\\*).\n\nThe study includes a cross-sectional design (comparison of subjects with and without obesity) to evaluate parameters associated with food addiction through validated questionnaires. The metabolic and behavioral profiles of the cohort will be characterized. The medial prefrontal cortex connectivity will be studied using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). The composition and functionality of the gut metagenome of the subjects will be analyzed in association with metabolic and behavioral parameters and imaging data. miRNAs can act as mediators of epigenomics of the effects of the metagenome that impact the brain, therefore it will be analyzed a broad profile of miRNAs circulating in plasma."

Determinants of CRF include lung capacity, capillary density, cardiac output, hemoglobin concentration, and mitochondrial function. The research group studies how CRF is related to fuel utilization, yielding a mechanistic understanding of the association between lower CRF and worsening metabolic health via mitochondrial function. The objective of this study is to measure fuel utilization in response to habitual diet for one week in adolescents and young adults, ages 14-22 years (n=30). Fuel utilization will be estimated by glucose measures using a continuous glucose monitor (CGM). Habitual dietary intake will be collected via a mobile phone application (BiteAI, Inc) that uses artificial intelligence to extract nutrient information from food photographs. Participants will undergo two standard of care (SOC) meal tolerance tests at home - a glucose tolerance test and a Ensure\u00ae mixed meal tolerance test. CRF will be estimated by measuring maximum oxygen consumption (VO2 max) during a graded treadmill test. The hypothesis is that a higher VO2 max will be associated with increased fuel utilization, measured by lower glucose response to the SOC meal tolerance tests. The proposed study is described in the following aims:\n\nSPECIFIC AIM 1. Test for feasibility of completion of self-report dietary food records, completion of two at home meal tolerance tests that are standard of care for metabolic health screening, and completion of a seven-day continuous glucose monitor.\n\nSPECIFIC AIM 2.

Some studies also show a long time between the start of treatment and signs of benefit. This has led to a review of current ways to normalize blood glucose control with basal bolus insulin and how to make blood glucose better. Improving blood sugar with insulin therapy usually causes weight gain, more high sugar levels after meals, and more low blood sugars. Early studies suggest that when people take long-acting insulin and metformin, they have fewer blood sugar extremes when they also take a new type of medicine called glucagon-like polypeptide-1 (GLP-1) agonist named exenatide (Byetta), instead of meal-time insulin. This means there might be a better way to treat Type 2 diabetes.\n\nParticipants are asked to take part in an eight month study to find out if middle-aged and older people with Type 2 diabetes who have added risk factors for heart disease can even out their blood sugar levels. They will start on long-acting insulin, mealtime insulin, and metformin, if they are not already on these medications. Their kidney function tests must be normal and they must not be allergic to metformin. Then, after a 2 month run-in phase, they must be willing to be assigned by chance into one of two groups. This means that they will have a 50/50 chance (like flipping a coin) of being in either group. Half of them will be started on the new medicine known as Byetta rather than the meal-time insulin and the other half will remain on the meal-time insulin during the next 6 months (26 weeks) to see which group has more steady blood sugars. They will be asked to use a continuous blood sugar monitoring system called DexCom. A sensor is inserted under the skin in the same areas the insulin is injected. The DexCom can check their blood sugars 24 hours of the day and night and will be worn until 7 days of recordings are collected. In the same 7 day period, they will also be asked to wear a Holter or Telemetry monitor that will record their heart beats and rhythm which will be compared to the blood sugar readings. They will also use home glucose meters to check their glucose levels about 3 to 4 times a day. The study will take place at 12 centers in the United States and enroll about 120-130 people."

High-intensity interval training (HIIT) has been proposed as a time-efficient methodology, consisting of sessions of short duration and high intensity exercises. An easier and cheaper training alternative for HIIT is exercising with elastic bands, either in a clinic or at home. Even so, training with elastic bands in T1D in combination with the HIIT method has not been compared to aerobic training.

Patients should re-test and re-ingest 15-20g carbohydrates every 15 minutes until they recover from hypoglycemia. These recommendations were principally based on two studies conducted in the 80s before the introduction of intensive insulin therapy. In practice, only 32-50% of patients follow the current guidelines. In addition, recent studies suggest that under current intensive insulin therapies, an initial correction with 15g of oral glucose may be insufficient to rapidly correct mild-to-moderate hypoglycemia. With the development and increasing usage of newer glucose monitoring technologies, the community is witnessing a shift in hypoglycemia management, from a reactive to a proactive approach (e.g., prevent imminent episodes rather than treating established episodes)."

            "Glucose control during labor is important for both fetus and mother. During labor and delivery, the goal is to maintain the sugars in the normal range as safely as possible as increased blood sugars 4-6 h prior to delivery leads to increased rates of hypoglycemia in the neonate. Neonatal hypoglycemia is a risk for the offspring of pregnant women with diabetes and occurs when fetal pancreatic hyperplasia is acutely stimulated by a high fetal glucose level derived from maternal hyperglycemia during labor. The maternal blood glucose level during delivery is a predictor of the neonatal blood glucose level. Modern continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) systems can capture the direction and magnitude of short-lived changes in interstitial glucose levels and are therefore useful for assessing glucose variability more accurately than self-monitoring blood glucose (SMBG) measurements. Indeed, it has already been demonstrated that intermittent blood glucose monitoring underestimates the number of hyperglycemic events, because blood glucose excursions can peak at different times of day. CGMs can help identify glycemic patterns in pregnancy, obtain and maintain glucose targets, and reduce hypoglycemia. Strict glycemic control during labor and delivery may reduce the risk of neonatal hypoglycemia. Two groups have reported on the use of CGM in type 1 diabetics during labor in small pilot studies. Another study looked at effects of maternal glucose levels in insulin-treated women during labor and delivery (2 to 8 h before birth) and resultant neonatal hypoglycemia. The researchers found that maternal hyperglycemia before delivery was correlated with neonatal hypoglycemia. Although more studies are needed, CGM use has promise as a therapy to improve outcomes in pregnancies associated with diabetes. In this study, the investigators plan to explore whether the use of blinded glucose monitoring during labor, delivery, and early postpartum supplementary to normally monitored plasma glucose measurements in women with gestational diabetes (GDM) would provide useful information to improve glycemia during labor in this diabetic population. All CGM data will be masked and therefore not available to participants, clinicians, or researchers at the time of delivery. Participants otherwise will receive standard clinical care. The blinded glucose monitoring data on glycemia throughout labor and post-delivery will be retrospectively assessed."

In addition, it has been shown that patients with T1D with no traditional CV risk factors had about a 80% higher risk of cardiovascular event compared to non-diabetic individuals. This indicates that further modifiable risk factors in relation to CV mortality remain to be identified.\n\nOne of the candidates that could help to disentangle the factors associated with the increased CV mortality in T1D patients is glycemic variability which could contribute to diabetes complications.

COPD complicates the management of invasive mechanical ventilation, particularly weaning of this invasive mechanical ventilation and extubation (removal of the intubation tube).\n\nTo reduce the risk of reintubation, it is recommended that a weaning test is performed prior to extubation. The purpose of this test is to simulate the conditions of breathing without the help of a ventilator after extubation. If the weaning test is successful, the patient can theoretically be extubated.\n\nThere are several causes associated with extubation failure, but studies suggest that sleep deprivation or poor sleep quality in the nights before extubation is one of them. In addition, patients with COPD often have chronic sleep disturbances or induced by their stay in the ICU (asthenia, bed rest, anxiety, sedation, etc.).\n\nThe aim of our study will be to compare the sleep characteristics of COPD patients with a failed weaning test and those with a successful test. Our hypothesis is that patients with a failed weaning test will have more sleep disturbances in the period of 72 hours before the weaning test."

            "Although multidisciplinary treatment of pediatric obesity has shown its effectiveness in leading to weight loss and improvement in the physical, mental and social health of children and adolescents; maintaining these benefits remains a real challenge. Indeed, the literature clearly shows a short- to medium-term increase in weight, the mechanisms of which have yet to be identified in order to prevent it. Although cognitive, behavioral and nutritional adaptations have been highlighted to explain this weight regain, metabolic and energetic adaptations also seem to contribute. Indeed, a reduction in resting and total energy expenditure has been shown (in connection with changes in body composition and in particular lean mass), but also of the energy cost during locomotion and mobility, thus altering the daily energy balance. These energy adaptations are also accompanied by a modification in the use of energy substrates due to a modification of muscular metabolic flexibility in particular, leading to a reduction in lipid oxidation in favor of carbohydrates. Importantly, if this reduction in the use of lipids generates a counterproductive sparing of adipose tissue, thus slowing down weight loss, the increase in carbohydrate oxidation leads to an intensification of orexigenic signals at the central level, promoting nutritional compensations and positive energy balance and therefore contributing to weight regain.\n\nThus, these adaptations of energy metabolism and their interactions with dietary control seem to be at the heart of the mechanisms limiting the success of obesity treatment, favoring weight gain. If these observations were made at the end of treatment programs lasting several weeks to months, a recent clinical work highlights the need to consider the kinetics and temporality of weight loss (weight loss variability and rate of weight loss), so as to identify the crucial stages where these adaptations take place and thus prevent their energy consequences.\n\nThus, the main objective of this project is to study total energy adaptations (energy and nutritional metabolism) at rest but also during locomotion, during the central phase of weight loss of adolescents with obesity, as well as during phases of weight regain. Ultimately, the objective of this study is to better understand energetic adaptations to weight loss and the implication of the degree of weight loss in order to study the role of the interaction between these adaptations and the degree of weight loss on the success of programs and on the profiles of \"weight maintainers\" or \"weight regainers\"."

Actually, there is no study observing the effect of this new stimulation method on populations with neurodegenerative pathologies, in particular in AD for which this technique could potentially become a therapeutic option.\n\nThe hypothesis is that of a strengthening of the memory consolidation capacities in subjects with AD as has been shown in healthy subjects."

            "The vagus nerve (VN) plays a crucial role in regulating vital functions (heart rate, blood pressure, digestion, and immune response) and maintaining communication between internal organs and the brain. Recent studies have highlighted the therapeutic potential of VN stimulation (VNS) in treating various conditions such as drug-resistant epilepsy, postural control deficit, COVID-19 infection, chronic pain, and intestinal disorders. In addition, there is growing evidence that the molecules released by the VN neurons affect the function of the gut microbiota and that the molecules released by the bacteria in our gut affect the activity of the VN neurons. In particular, Dr. Giacomo Carta (the leader of this study) has shown how painless neck movements, i.e. mechanical VNS (mVNS), can be applied without adverse effects, representing a potential alternative to invasive methods commonly used today. To further investigate the impact of this novel mVNS, this study aims to evaluate the changes induced by three mVNS protocols on physiological parameters such as resting heart rate, and Heart Rate Variability (HRV) at rest, balance in standing, the perceived intensity of mechanical stimuli using the established clinical method of QST (quantitative sensory testing), fecal transit speed, and the molecular composition of stool (for this, stool samples are analyzed). In particular, stool analysis is very relevant for understanding normal digestion. The present research aims to define the optimal intensity of mVNS and to investigate the therapeutic potential of VNS in the treatment of autonomic dysfunction (such as too low or too high heart rate, too low or too fast digestion, throbbing headaches), as well as falls prevention and pain."

            "Approximately 70% of American adults have overweight/obesity, which increases risk of major medical issues and preventable death (Abdelaal et. al, 2017). Many individuals with overweight/obesity attempt to lose weight through behavioral strategies, e.g., adopting a reduced-calorie diet and/or increased physical activity. However, it is exceedingly difficult to consistently adhere to a reduced-calorie diet and high levels of physical activity; as such, most individuals attempting to lose weight via these methods experience repeated instances of non-adherence, i.e., dietary and physical activity lapses. These lapses are a core driver of weight loss failure, undermining individuals' ability to achieve weight control (Forman et al, 2017). As such, it is important to understand what predicts these lapses, which in turn allows for better lapse prevention. The current study proposes to measure these risk factors in an ecologically valid manner, i.e., in the moment they occur and in the context of individuals' everyday lives, using advanced technology. Specifically, the current study will use ecological momentary assessments (EMA; brief, repeated surveys delivered in one's natural environment, typically via a smartphone) and sensor technology (e.g., Fitbit and sensors on smartphone devices) to measure momentary risk factors of dietary and physical activity lapse, as well as the lapses themselves. Findings from this research project will lay the groundwork for a sophisticated just-in-time adaptive intervention (JITAI), a tailored, personalized intervention that targets momentary risk factors (e.g., cravings) via in-the-moment support, thereby reducing lapse occurrence and improving adherence to behavioral weight control prescriptions."

            "This project examined the impact of virtual reality (VR)-based physical activity on the functional status and quality of life (QoL) of older residents in a nursing home. It is know that VR-related therapy and activation programs help in a positive attitude toward health and emotions, reduce susceptibility to depression and social isolation, and enhance engagement in physical activities. As an atrractive and motivating tools, VR have the potential to promote greater physical activity and overall improvement, including functional status and QoL in older adults. Such findings indicate that incorporating VR into exercise programs for the older adults may enhancements in functional status and QoL compared to traditional, non-VR-based therapy.\n\nThe primary goal of this study was to assess changes in functional status and QoL in older participants in VR-based physical activity. The project involves a comprehensive evaluation, including assessments of physical and psychomotor fitness, body composition, key blood morphology parameters, lipid profile, blood glucose levels, oral microbiome composition, and overall well-being. Additionally, psychological factors such as anxiety levels is examined, assuming that these parameters may improve through VR-enhanced physical activity.\n\nThe investigators hypothesize that VR-based therapy will leads to significant improvements in psychomotor and functional fitness, exercise tolerance, and overall well-being, thereby enhancing the QoL in older adults. The findings of this research may contribute to the development of innovative programs aimed at supporting elderly individuals in maintaining and improving their functional status-whether during recovery, rehabilitation, or in sustaining optimal physical and mental health."

            "Chronic neuropathic pain affects 69% of adults with spinal cord injury (SCI). Current treatment options are limited (primarily pain medications) with insufficient benefits and significant risks for addiction and adverse effects. Of the available mind and body approaches, Qigong is the most accessible for adults with SCI with evidence for effectiveness in reducing pain, but there is insufficient evidence to make recommendations for adults with SCI. Thus, the feasibility of Qigong in SCI needs to be established.\n\nTo support our feasibility study, we investigated a 12-week remote Qigong program in adults with SCI and neuropathic pain. We recruited 23 adults with SCI, 18 completed the study, and 12 completed the 1-year follow-up. They practiced Qigong 138% of the required intensity (which was, at least 3x/week with Qigong video through the internet). Their pain was reduced by 44% after 12 weeks of Qigong practice and was still reduced at the 6-week and 1-year follow-up. However, three key elements need to be addressed before performing a larger effectiveness study: (1) feasibility/acceptability of Qigong from adults with SCI of diverse backgrounds; (2) feasibility of the study design with control group); and (3) objective outcome measures.\n\nThis R34 feasibility study, the HAPPINESS trial (cHAnging the Perceived Pain INtensity in divErSe populations with Spinal cord injury), will expand on our prior study to consolidate feasibility with a rigorous protocol. We will address the following aims: AIM 1. Identify the facilitators/barriers to participating in a Qigong study through focus groups/interviews with stakeholders from diverse backgrounds, defined as Hispanics, veterans, and adults living in rural, underserved areas. AIM 2. Establish the feasibility of study design/methods of the HAPPINESS trial in adults with SCI (at least 50% of diverse backgrounds) through pre-specified targets for recruitment/enrollment, feasibility, and acceptability of design and outcomes. Using a Phase I randomized controlled trial design, 40 adults with SCI-related neuropathic pain will be randomized to 12-week remote Qigong intervention OR a short daily pain management survey that can be completed on phone/iPad/computer + 6-month follow-up. The study results will facilitate a rigorous structure to design larger effectiveness studies and facilitate a clear pathway for researchers to investigate Qigong and other mind-body approaches for whole-person health in diverse groups of adults with chronic/neurological disorders."

There are three main objectives of the protocol: 1) to determine if a physical activity intervention tailored to older African American adults is effective in modifying cognitive function associated with Alzheimer's Disease, 2) to determine if a physical activity intervention tailored to older African American adults is effective in modifying brain function and structure associated with Alzheimer's Disease, and 3) to determine if a physical activity promotion intervention tailored to African American adults is effective at enhancing physiological parameters. The primary endpoints for the study are episodic memory and executive functioning. The secondary outcomes include anthropometry, blood pressure, brain activation, cerebral blood flow, volume of whole brain and white matter hyperintensities, cardiorespiratory fitness, objectively measured physical activity, circulating hormones, and telomere length."

            "Young adults born very preterm (32 weeks gestation or earlier) do not respond well to aerobic exercise training, meeting the recommendations set by the Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans, where they do not increase their fitness level (or cardiorespiratory fitness). Thus, they do not receive the health benefits of exercise. Achieving physical fitness through aerobic exercise training is the most cost-effective method for preventing and treating many diseases. Young adults born very preterm also have a higher risk of these conditions. Thus, their inability to respond to increase their fitness is a major problem.\n\nOne likely explanation for poor exercise trainability and increased heart disease risk in young adults born very preterm is the effect of the early birth on the major energy producers in all our cells: Mitochondria. During late-stage gestation, mitochondria change from relying on sugar as a major fuel source to fat. Unfortunately, individuals born very preterm miss this transition in fuel source reliance, which causes significant stress and damage to mitochondria. Mitochondria are critical for post-natal organ development; thus, it is thought that preterm birth-induced mitochondrial dysfunction is the underlying cause of poor trainability and high disease risk in young adults born very preterm. Indeed, mitochondrial dysfunction is evident in these individuals.\n\nTo date, there is not a way to help young adults born preterm improve their fitness level. One likely target is in the mitochondria: it's DNA. Mitochondrial DNA helps determine how mitochondria function and can be damaged under stress. Our goal in this proposed work is to determine the role of mitochondrial DNA in mitochondrial dysfunction and its link to their poor trainability.\n\nQuestions:\n\n1. Are there mitochondrial DNA markers linked to mitochondrial dysfunction and poor exercise trainability in young adults very born preterm?\n2. Do mitochondrial DNA in young adults born very preterm respond differently to aerobic exercise training than those born at term?\n\nThe investigators expect this work will show mitochondrial DNA changes linked to mitochondrial dysfunction and poor trainability, which can be used for future targets to improve health. This work supports AHA mission by helping to identify a marker in individuals born very preterm linked to their higher heart disease risk and death early in life."

            "Approximately 45% of older adults in the U.S. have 2 or more chronic health conditions (e.g., arthritis, hypertension, diabetes) in addition to functional limitations that prevent performance of health self-management activities. Self-management continues to be the gold standard for managing MCC, but functional limitations create difficulty with these activities (e.g., physical activity, symptom monitoring). Restricted self-management accelerates the downward spiral of disability and accumulating chronic conditions which, in turn, increases rates of institutionalization and death by 5-fold. Currently, there are no tested interventions designed to improve independence in health self-management activities in older adults with MCC and functional limitations. Research suggests that older adults are more likely to change behavior with interventions that assist with planning health-promoting daily activities, especially when contending with complex medical regimens and functional limitations. Combined with occupational therapy (OT), behavioral activation (BA) shows promise to improve health self-management in populations with chronic conditions and/or functional limitations. This innovative combination uses the goal setting, scheduling/monitoring activities, and problem-solving components of the BA approach as well as the environmental modification, activity adaptation, and focus on daily routines from OT practice. The investigators will test the effect of this combined approach in a Stage I, randomized controlled pilot feasibility study compared to enhanced usual care. The investigators will recruit 40 older adults with MCC and functional limitation and randomize 20 to the PI- delivered BA-OT protocol. This research will inform modification and larger-scale testing of this novel intervention and provide data for a federally funded career development award."

Physical activity (PA) is the second largest predictor of stroke and the cornerstone of secondary prevention therapies. Adaptive interventions involve sequential treatments responsive to individuals' performance. Despite guidelines to adapt PA to individuals' needs, there is no evidence on the empirical development of adaptive PA interventions post-stroke. The evidence is dominated by standard trial designs, used to evaluate non-adaptive PA interventions. This trial will make original contributions to the literature by designing a first-in-class adaptive PA intervention using an innovative experimental design. This design will permit the delivery of optimal sequences of treatments to increase PA for individuals. Furthermore, by developing a user-informed smartphone application, this feasibility trial will lead to the design and evaluation of a highly-scalable definitive intervention to reduce the risk of recurrent stroke.\n\nAim To use a Sequential Multiple-Assignment Randomised Trial (SMART) design to develop an adaptive, user-informed mobile health (mHealth) intervention to improve PA post-stroke. Subsequently this adaptive intervention will be evaluated against a treatment-as-usual control using a standard trial design in a definitive trial.\n\nMethods A co-design process was used to develop the technology platform for intervention delivery. There are two components which target increased PA in the current intervention: Structured Exercise and Lifestyle PA. The SMART will determine what sequence and/or combination of these intervention components produces the greatest increase in physical activity as measured by average daily step count. The primary outcome will be PA (steps/day), with clear feasibility and secondary clinical and cost outcomes. A SMART design will be used to evaluate the optimum adaptive PA intervention among people post-mild-to-moderate stroke."

However, results vary, potentially due to inconsistencies in how MABT components are utilized and emphasized. Optimizing MABTs using a typical approach, i.e., successive randomized controlled trials of various MABT packages, is slow and difficult. Multiphase Optimization Strategy (MOST) has been developed as a better method of optimizing treatment. Consistent with Phase I of MOST, we derived three MABT components from the theoretical literature. Evaluation of MABT components through a factorial design (MOST Phase II) will allow us to determine the independent and interacting efficacies of each MABT component, in addition to the identification of subsets of individuals most or least responsive to each component. Whereas mediational analyses have been inconclusive, the use of a factorial design will allow for a critical test of the main and interaction effects of individual MABT treatment components.

However, the optimal exercise prescription required to achieve pain sensitivity reduction is currently unclear. The next step is to determine experimentally whether increasing physical fitness will lead to positive effects on central pain processing (i.e., pain sensitivity, pain modulation, spinal nociception). The aim of this study is to examine the effects of two exercise programs on central pain processing in healthy sedentary individuals. In case of positive effects, this would provide a rationale for the future to investigate this in chronic pain patients with impaired pain modulation."

The main question of the study is to answer the effectiveness of notification on activity, sleep, and nutrition based on wearable device Fitbit recorded data for the improvement of health conditions including intellectual property and physical function, compared to usual care. Participants in the intervention arm will be given a Fitbit Charge 5 device and asked to wear this for the duration of the study, including during sleep. The study intervention will run for 6 months. Notifications will be issued using a monitoring software in Japanese, and issued automatically to participants. Participants in the control arm will be given a routine care and health-related information. Researchers will compare cognitive performance, muscle mass and physical activity between the two groups to see if the notification based on Fitbit data would promote the health conditions of older adults."

Patients will be randomised to either an enhanced behavioural change intervention targeting multiple health behaviours vs a simple walking intervention. Also, some patients will be involved in focus groups to understand their experience of the intervention and whether it is feasible and acceptable, allowing changes to be made to the program.\n\nThe primary outcome will be to assess the feasibility and acceptability of the program.

New technology, such as continuous glucose monitors (CGM), help to better identify hypoglycaemia and develop strategies to avoid it. These devices measure glucose in the skin, rather than in the blood, and provide information not only on how low glucose is, but also for how long. Recent studies showed that over half of episodes of low glucose with these systems are not recognised by people with diabetes, and even people without diabetes have sensor values that are below the current thresholds for hypoglycaemia \\[ low blood glucose\\] that we measure with traditional monitors.\n\nIn this study, the investigators will evaluate the impact of symptomatic as well as asymptomatic episodes of low sensor glucose on a variety of clinical, patient-related and health economic outcomes such as mood, quality of sleep and productivity. The investigators will test different levels and durations of low sensor glucose to identify the one that best matches episodes that are symptomatic to best define hypoglycaemia using these systems.\n\nThe investigators will also look at factors that influence this such as sleep or activity as well as diabetes management behaviours (such as insulin dosing, carb counting, etc).

Although medication can assist nurses to improve these symptoms simultaneously in a short period of time, they are at risk of overuse of benzodiazepine hypnotics. Previous research supports the usefulness of cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) as self-management strategies in adults with insomnia, anxiety, depression, and pain. However, their effects on post COVID-19 condition have not been researched, and no previous head-to-head study compared the effects on these two approaches on insomnia and neuropsychiatric symptoms.\n\nAim: To investigate the effects of CBT-I on insomnia, anxiety, depression, and pain in nurses with post COVID-19 condition.\n\nMethods: In this two-arm, parallel randomized controlled trial, 100 participants will be 1:1 randomly assigned to one of two groups (CBT-I and control). The intervention phase will last 6 weeks, followed by a three-month follow-up. Primary outcomes are insomnia severity and sleep quality, whereas anxiety, depression, pain, and health-related quality of life are secondary outcomes. These variables will be assessed before and after the intervention, and at 1, 2, and 3 months after the end of the intervention. Additionally, discontinuing benzodiazepine hypnotics will be measured at 3 months after the end of the intervention.\n\nDiscussion: This study will provide evidence of the effects of CBT-I on improving insomnia, anxiety, depression, and pain among nurses with post COVID-19 condition. Results could also enhance means by which to discontinue benzodiazepine hypnotics."

The gut microbiome plays an important role in overall health and has been shown to dynamically change in response to early-stage triple-negative breast cancer-directed therapies, which in turn has been associated with worse outcomes. As the gut microbiome can be further modulated with dietary changes during cancer treatment, it is an ideal potential modifiable risk factor in cancer patients. However, due to multiple confounding factors such as dietary intake, mood, and activity, its utility as part of the oncologic clinical assessment remains unclear.\n\nIn this prospective randomized controlled study, the investigators propose to recruit up to 30 early-stage TNBC patients to randomize to a personalized nutritional intervention of a high-fiber diet coached by a registered dietician versus educational handout alone during neoadjuvant treatment. The investigators propose to study the gut microbiota through stool sample analysis among early-stage triple-negative breast cancer patients undergoing neoadjuvant (i.e. before surgery) chemotherapy +/- immunotherapy. The investigators will also study how the gut microbiota can be further modulated with a high-fiber diet, and the investigators hypothesize that a high-fiber diet may play a protective role in preserving gut microbial diversity. As part of the nutritional intervention, the investigators propose to administer nutritional counseling with a registered dietitian (RD) to increase fiber intake and tracking performance status, activity, and mood during neoadjuvant treatment. Finally, the investigators propose to survey participants after study completion through one-on-one interviews to determine whether participants experienced improved overall patient satisfaction in supportive care during their treatment."

            "In recent years, due to the popularity of exercise during pregnancy, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommends that pregnant women should engage in 150 minutes of moderate-intensity exercise per week, including aerobic exercise or weight training. This can help reduce pregnancy complications (such as preeclampsia, gestational diabetes, pelvic pain, etc.) and does not increase the risk of miscarriage or premature birth. Pelvic pain during pregnancy is the most troublesome problem for pregnant women, often affecting their daily lives and mental health, leading to the need for long-term use of painkillers and even affecting their daily routine and sleep. Currently, research has also found that exercise during pregnancy can improve pelvic pain during pregnancy and reduce the inconvenience caused by pain in daily life. However, weight training can strengthen spinal stability and reduce lower back pain problems in non-pregnant individuals, but there is currently no research discussing whether weight training for pregnant women can improve pelvic pain during pregnancy, possibly because weight training for pregnant women is not widely accepted by society and is often associated with misconceptions and prejudices. Recent literature synthesis analysis tells us that weight training during pregnancy does not increase the risk of premature birth or miscarriage. Pregnant women in supervised moderate-intensity weight training do not endanger the health of the mother or fetus, and the safety is sufficient. Therefore, we hope to understand the effects and mechanisms of weight training during pregnancy on pelvic pain during pregnancy through this study."

            "This study will adapt a physical activity lifestyle intervention to adolescent and emerging adult congenital heart disease (CHD) survivors with the primary goal of increasing physical activity levels.\n\nThe study will be split into 2 phases. In Phase 1, participants will be asked to complete questionnaires, wear an accelerometer around the waist for 7 days, and undergo an exercise stress test. The accelerometer and exercise stress test will be used to determine whether participants are eligible to be randomized for the intervention study. For adolescent participants, a parent will be asked to complete questionnaires at baseline as well. In Phase 2, participants will be randomized to one of two conditions: 1) receiving a physical activity tracker (a Fitbit) or 2) receiving a Fitbit AND engaging in videoconferencing sessions with a physical activity coach. During Phase 2, participants will also be asked to complete 3 assessments (weeks 9 and 22, and a 6-month follow-up). The week 9 assessment will consist of completing questionnaires and wearing an accelerometer for 7 days. Week 22 will be similar to week 9 with the addition of a final exercise stress test. The 6-month follow-up will mirror the week 9 assessment. For adolescent participants, the same parent will be asked to complete questionnaires at the final assessment as well.\n\nParticipants who are randomized to the videoconferencing condition will be asked to meet with a physical activity coach 8 times over the course of 20 weeks. Coaches will help participants to (1) change attitudes toward physical activity, (2) increase perception of others' approval of physical activity (e.g., family members, peers), and (3) increase participants' perceived control by troubleshooting barriers and increasing efficacy for physical activity. Coaches will use the Fitbit to facilitate self-monitoring and goal setting. Participants in the intervention arm will be asked to participate in a focus group at the conclusion of the study to share their experiences."

            "The main purpose of this project is to investigate the influence of cushioning material at both the rear and the forepart of running shoes on musculoskeletal complaints in leisure-time runners. Therefore, the objectives are to investigate if\n\n1. \"Extra soft\" cushioning materials can reduce injury risk compared to stiffer materials;\n2. Cushioning under the forepart of the shoe also influences injury risk, independently of the cushioning at the rear part;\n3. Effects of cushioning material and position depend on the runner's body mass;\n4. Perception of cushioning is related to both shoe cushioning and injury risk;\n5. Other weight-bearing locomotion activities (i.e., number of steps per day besides running practice) represents an independent risk factor for running-related injury.\n\nThis study consists in a 6-month intervention trial during which leisure-time runners are required to follow their usual training schedule. Before the beginning of the study, the participants will receive a pair of running shoes. The three running shoe models will be exactly the same, except for their foam properties at the rear and forepart of the shoe, which will differ by 33 and 37%, respectively. The study shoes will be administered through random allocation. The participants will be required to use these shoes for all running sessions, and only for running activities.\n\nParticipants will first fill out a baseline questionnaire. During the intervention, data on running practice will be downloaded from sports watches via their respective app. Information on the use of the study shoes will be collected via a weekly questionnaire. Participants will be asked to fill out a weekly questionnaire on any musculoskeletal complaints experienced during the past 7 days. A questionnaire on the perception of cushioning will be filled in by the participants at three time points (after 5h of running, 25h of running, and at the end of follow-up).\n\nPrimary hypothesis:\n\n- Greater shock absorption properties at the rear part of running shoes are associated with a lower injury risk in recreational runners.\n\nSecondary hypothesis:\n\n* Greater shock absorption properties under the forepart of the shoe are also associated with lower injury risk in recreational runners.\n* Runners with low body mass experience a lower injury risk in shoes with greater shock absorption properties.\n* Greater perceived cushioning is related to lower injury risk."

Different professional societies, including the German Society of Pneumology and the European Respiratory Society, recommend rehabilitation intervention to reduce the sequelae of COVID-19. However, from the perspective of science and practice, there are relevant areas that have been insufficiently investigated and are essential for the treatment success of post/long COVID patients:\n\n* Differentiation of rehabilitation effects from natural recovery after COVID-19.\n* Lack of personalized and symptom-based treatment approaches that can address the heterogeneity of symptoms in post/long COVID\n* Lack of uniform, high-quality rehabilitation standards in post-/long-COVID.\n\nTherefore, post-COVID patients will be recruited at several post-COVID practices around Germany and randomized to receive (A) a rehabilitation program or (B) usual care. The primary objective of this randomized controlled trial (RCT) is to investigate whether a 3-week symptom-oriented, inpatient, multidisciplinary rehabilitation intervention, whose content focus is standardized according to cluster assignment (fatigue, cognition, soma), has a positive effect on the quality of life (primary outcome) in post-COVID syndrome patients compared to a usual care group (standard outpatient care).

The investigators hypothesize that: (1) adverse changes in the myocardium may occur during exercise in acute normobaric hypoxia, but they are at least partially reversed by adaptive alterations induced by training in hypoxia; (2) this response is identical in athletes with eccentric cardiac hypertrophy and those with concentric cardiac hypertrophy.\n\nThe study consists of three stages. Stage 1 (completed) has examine changes in the blood levels of cardiac biomarkers in response to a single bout of exercise performed until volitional exhaustion in normoxia and during different levels of hypoxia (2000, 3000m). This stage has examined men aged 20-40 years involved in competitive cycling and triathlon, and untrained, healthy men.\n\nStage 2 of the study will examine changes in the blood levels of cardiac biomarkers in cyclists (aged 20-40) in response to a 3-week endurance training in hypoxia and to passive prolonged exposure (11 to 12 hours a day) to a simulated altitude of 3000m. Stage 3 will examine changes in blood levels of cardiac biomarkers in response to a 3-week resistance training in hypoxia (3000m). This stage of the study will involve men aged 20-40 training in strength sports.\n\nThe project will help clarify the effects of hypoxia on the physiological state of the heart in athletes with eccentric or concentric cardiac hypertrophy, as well as determine the differences between competitive athletes vs. untrained, healthy men in the response to hypoxia. The findings may be used in planning and controlling the training process in both strength and endurance disciplines.

However, it seems difficult to adhere to an optimal program as described in the literature for these fatigued patients. The investigators want to test a device that would both reduce fatigue and improve recovery between APA sessions, in order to gradually reach the recommendations for APA practice.

            "Background:\n\nThe presence of T-lymphocytes in resected tumor samples derived from long-term survival patients and the fact that reinvigoration of their functionality through the administration of specific immune-therapies can lead to remarkable antitumor responses supports that lymphocytes play a critical role in cancer immunity.\n\nTIL-based ACT (Adoptive cell therapy using tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes product) is a modality of ACT used to treat patients with multiple types of cancer and it consists in the adoptive transfer of ex vivo expanded autologous tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes obtained from tumor resection or tumor biopsies in patients following a non-myeloablative lymphodepleting (NMA-LD) chemotherapy. Ex vivo expansion of TIL relies on the non-specific expansion of lymphocytes present in tumor single cell suspensions or tumor fragments in high dose IL-2.\n\nAlthough proven efficacy in selected, the HD-IL-2 use remains relatively restricted due to toxicity. Due to the short serum half-life and the need to achieve an immune-modulatory effect in the tissues, IL-2 must be given in doses that induce severe systemic toxicities, including capillary leak syndrome (CLS), pulmonary edema, hypotension, acute renal insufficiency, and rarely myocarditis, limiting its applicability in cancer. Studies comparing HD-IL-2 with lower doses both in renal cell carcinoma and metastatic melanoma to minimize toxicity demonstrated the superiority of the high dose regimens in both diseases. These drawbacks of HD-IL-2 use encouraged the development of improved IL-2-based biologic agents with higher selectivity for effector immune cell subsets, reduced toxicity, and prolonged half-life.\n\nANV419 is a novel IL-2 agent, which has been developed as a preferentially IL-2R\u03b2\u03b3 directed fusion protein with a longer half-life. It has shown high effector selectivity and a favorable safety profile in preclinical testing, including in nonhuman primates, and it has been investigated in an ongoing open-label, dose-escalation Phase I Study in multiple tumor types. he safety profile of ANV419 is characterized by pyrexia, nausea, vomiting, ALT/AST changes and CRS in some patients. Most events are low grade and self-limiting and manageable with standard supportive care. ANV419 was well-tolerated by most patients. No patient discontinued treatment due to treatment related AE.\n\nTaking all the previous information into account, the primary objectives of this study are:\n\n1. To determine whether TIL-ACT using the IL-2 analog ANV419 reduces the mean number of predefined grade \u22653 relevant adverse events related to interleukin use (based on Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events v5.0 - CTCAE v5.0) compared to TIL-ACT using HD-IL-2.\n2.

            "Acute Effects of Aerobic Exercise on Flow Mediated Slowing and Flow Mediated Dilation in Adults with and Without Type 2 Diabetes",
            "The endothelium is a protective lining of cells inside blood vessels. It keeps blood vessels working smoothly by controlling how wide or narrow your blood vessels are and protecting them from damage. Normally, the endothelium keeps a healthy balance between signals that relax or tighten blood vessels. But with advancing age or certain diseases like diabetes, this balance is disrupted. This can make blood vessels weaker and lead to serious problems in the heart and other organs.\n\nResearchers use a test called brachial flow-mediated dilation (FMD) to check how well blood vessels work. FMD shows how good blood vessels are at making a chemical called nitric oxide (NO), which helps them relax and widen. During the FMD test, researchers reduce blood flow for a short time with a blood pressure cuff, then release it to see how blood vessels respond. They use an ultrasound machine to measure this. While FMD is useful, it has some downsides-it's hard to do right, needs expensive tools, and experts don't always agree on how to analyze the results. A newer method called flow-mediated slowing (FMS) aims to fix these problems. FMS uses pulse wave velocity (PWV) to measure how stiff your blood vessels are. Stiffer vessels mean less nitric oxide and a higher chance of heart problems. After reducing blood flow with a blood pressure cuff and releasing it, healthy people show a drop in PWV (reduction in arterial stiffness), but people with heart failure or high blood pressure do not. Thus, FMS holds promise as it is an easier way to measure blood vessel health.\n\nExercise training helps keep blood vessels healthy with advancing age. Research has shown that regular aerobic exercise, (running or biking), and strength exercise (lifting weights), can improve how blood vessels work and make them less stiff. This is true even for healthy people. For people with type 2 diabetes, exercise training is even more important to preserve blood vessel health. The intensity of exercise may determine how much blood vessels improve. Research has shown that high-intensity interval training (HIIT)-where you switch between hard exercise and rest-works better than steady, moderate exercise for making blood vessels healthier and less stiff. It is thought that HIIT improves blood vessel health partly by improving how the body uses insulin. Still, not all studies show that training improves blood vessel health in people with type 2 diabetes.\n\nA single session of exercise presents a challenge to blood vessels that allows researchers to understand how exercise over time improves blood vessel health. In addition, studying how blood vessels react to one workout (called the acute exercise model) is helpful because researchers can easily control things like the type of exercise, how hard it is, or how long it lasts. Acute exercise research also helps control other factors, such as nutrition, that may bias results. Thus, acute exercise research is a great method to learn how exercise works in the short term and how it might help in the long run.\n\nTherefore, the present study aimed to determine how FMD and FMS respond after an acute bout of high-intensity interval exercise and moderate continuous exercise in older adults without type 2 diabetes, and also healthy young adults.\n\nThe key research questions were:\n\n1. Is the FMD and FMS response after an acute bout of exercise dependent on exercise intensity?\n2. Is the FMD and FMS response after an acute bout of exercise dependent on age and disease status?\n\nAll participants were asked to:\n\nComplete two exercise sessions - one moderate- and one high-intensity interval bout on a treadmill. The order of the sessions was randomly assigned, similar to flipping a coin.\n\nFMD and FMS were measured before and after each acute exercise bout in the laboratory.\n\nThe researchers compared FMD and FMS responses between exercise intensities (high vs. moderate) and populations (individuals with and without type diabetes)."

            "A good understanding of the principles of balance is vital to achieve optimal outcomes when treating spinal disorders. A complex interaction of the neuromotor system and muscular recruitment is necessary for ergonomic balance and deliberate displacement of the human body. Sagittal plane misalignment in spinal deformities challenges balance mechanisms used for maintenance of an upright posture. The occurrence of postoperative complications after spinal deformity correction like under-correction of sagittal misalignment, postoperative reciprocal changes in thoracic kyphosis, proximal junctional kyphosis and failure of instrumentation are possibly due to the current state-of-the art inadequate diagnostic work-up.\n\nInvestigators do not fully understand the roll of vision and exact strategy of recruitment of neuromuscular units (trunk, pelvis, lower limbs) in patients with sagittal plane misalignment during standing and walking. To understand this, a dynamic evaluation of individuals with spinal deformities is needed. Currently there is only very little research performed in the field of clinical balance tests and instrumented movement analysis in patients with spinal deformity.\n\nThe challenge for future studies is to further unravel the relation between trunk and lower limb movements, grouped into functional movement patterns. Moreover, additional information on trunk and lower limb kinetics and muscle activity (using dynamic electromyography (EMG)) will highly contribute to the understanding of this functional relationship, and will provide more in-depth insights into compensatory mechanisms of the trunk versus the lower limbs and vice versa."

Many of the health benefits are associated with reduced psychological and physiological stress leading to better autonomic functioning as assessed by heart rate variability (HRV) and other biomarkers. Multiple studies suggest that PA and exposure to natural environments may act together to improve health. Yet, aside from our preliminary studies, we are not aware of any studies that examined how physical activity may interact with exposure to urban Greenspace ('Green') compared with built urban environments ('Gray'), to reduce stress and improve health. The purpose of this proposed study is to conduct a randomized crossover trial comparing differences in the psychosocial and physiological effects of walking in urban Green and Gray spaces in adults with PreD."

            "In cancer patients, the integration between anticancer therapies and palliative care is of fundamental importance. In this context, telemedicine can improve the quality of life (QoL) of chronic patients through self-management and remote monitoring solutions. This approach can favor the effectiveness of the treatment and therapeutic adherence. Of note, telemedicine can also be applied to the management of cancer pain. In the advanced stages of cancer disease, pain is one of the most obvious and most disabling symptoms. Consequently, proper pain management has a significant impact on the QoL, the ability to withstand treatment, and the recovery of patients. On the other hand, given the complexity of cancer pain, the main obstacle to its proper management is the lack of adequate measurement methods. Although in recent years a great deal of effort has been made in the direction of automatic pain assessment, both concerning the creation of datasets and the development of classification algorithms, the literature is lacking regarding the automatic measurement of pain in the setting of cancer patients. Observation by experienced clinical staff and self-assessment by patients could be useful for obtaining the ground truth and, in turn, for training automatic pain recognition systems."

No reliable method of predicting perceived dying currently exists although the technology is available (sensors, algorithms).\n\nThe aim of Decoding Death and Dying in Dementia by Digital thanotyping (5-D) is to provide methods and tools to diagnose and describe dying to an unprecedented level of accuracy and robustness, within a timespan larger than is possible now, focusing on the case of dying people with dementia as one of the most vulnerable and difficult to study groups. 5-D combines clinical assessment tools with wearable sensing technology to monitor a) pain and distressing symptoms, b) behavioral and psychological symptoms in dementia (BPSD), c) oral changes, and to decode \"the point of no return\" as the beginning of perceived dying.\n\nTo obtain this outcome in nursing home patients with dementia, the investigator will test the main hypothesis: from monitoring the evolution of thanotype components over time and their interdependencies, the prediction of the \"point of no return\" is possible. The objectives of 5-D are:\n\nO1. Collect data using sensors and validated assessment scales. O2. Develop estimation methods for BPSD from sensor measurements. O3. Develop digital tools to capture the expression of pain. O4. Determine the relationship between breathing and oral symptoms. O5. Develop models for symptom interdependencies at the end of life and the \"point of no return\".\n\nO6. Perform human-in-the-loop validation of developed tools, models, and algorithms.\n\nThe ground-breaking interdisciplinary novelty of 5-D endeavors to enhance the understanding of end-of-life underlying pain and symptoms in people with dementia.

This can profoundly affect the ability of active duty (AD) women to advance in their career. The first 12 weeks postpartum are the time period during which the most significant weight loss occurs and is critical in achieving a healthy weight in the first year postpartum. Many factors contribute to effective weight loss in this period among which the most critical are diet, exercise, and sleep. Breast feeding and depression may also affect weight changes postpartum. Research has shown diet to likely be the most crucial of these factors.\n\nThe PADaWL study is designed as a randomized controlled trial to assess the effects of dietary intervention on weight and physical fitness versus routine postpartum care in the first year postpartum. Subjects will be primiparous AD women from any military service recruited in the obstetric clinic in the third trimester of pregnancy at Tripler Army Medical Center. Data will collected in an ambi-directional fashion with pre-pregnancy physical fitness data, demographic and pregnancy data collected at time of enrollment. Subjects will be randomized to receive intensive virtual sessions with a dietician vs routine postpartum care for the first 12 months postpartum. We will utilize a biometric device to monitor activity levels and sleep, web-based diaries to monitor breast feeding and diet, and validated questionnaires to evaluate depression as well as diet and sleep. Subjects will be monitored weekly for the first 12 weeks postpartum and will then be further evaluated at 6, 9 and 12 months postpartum.\n\nPrimary outcome is weight at 12weeks postpartum and whether subjects have achieved military standards. Secondary outcome will be weight at 12 months postpartum and whether subject has achieved weight and fitness standards. The study intends to collect large amounts of data, and we intend to analyze which factors may be contributing to weight retention postpartum.\n\nThis study should provide an accurate assessment of the effects of pregnancy on AD women. It should generate a clean and accurate dataset on which multiple follow-on studies can be performed and provide data for designing further intervention studies in postpartum women. The results of this study should also be able to assist in developing policy and guidance concerning AD women and pregnancy."

            "A panic attack (PA) is an intense form of anxiety accompanied by multiple somatic presentations, leading to frequent emergency department visits and impairing quality of life. A prediction model for PAs could help clinicians and patients monitor, control, and do early intervention for recurrent panic attacks, enabling more personalized treatment for panic disorder. This study aimed to provide a seven-day PA prediction model and determine the relationship between a future PA and various features, including physiological factors, anxiety and depressive factors, and air quality index. We will enroll 200 participants (150 participants join case management with wearables study, 50 participants join TAU group) with PD (DMS-5 and MINI interview). Participants used smartwatches (Garmin vivosmart 4) and mobile applications to collect their sleep, heart rate, activity level, anxiety, and depression scores (BDI, BAI, STAI-S, STAI-T, and PDSS-SR) in their real-life for a duration of one year. We also included air quality indexes from open data. To analyze these data, our team used six machine learning methods: random forests, decision trees, LDA, AdaBoost, XGBoost, and regularized greedy forests, or other deep learning methods."

            "Changes in Peak Fat Oxidation and Aerobic Fitness During Pre-season in Sub-elite Football Players",
            "Cross-sectional studies clearly demonstrate that the maximal fat oxidation (MFO, onwards referred to as peak fat oxidation, PFO) and the intensity at which it occurs (Fatmax) are higher in trained compared with untrained men and women (Maunder et al. 2018; Nordby et al. 2006; Lima-Silva et al. 2010). Furthermore, a recent study in endurance-trained males have shown a relationship between PFO and performance in an Ironman triathlon (Frandsen et al. 2017). The interest of PFO and Fatmax in endurance sports is centered on the speculation that increased fat oxidation rates during exercise would benefit endurance performance (\\> 4 hours) due to a glycogen sparing effect. Furthermore, it is speculated that the high amount of low-intensity training (70-80%), as seen with elite endurance athletes, might be essential in order to increase the fat oxidation capacity. However, when PFO is compared across an athletic population, football players have similar values as endurance-trained athletes (Randell et al. 2016; Randell et al. 2019; Frandsen et al. 2017), which is somewhat surprising when the different training regimes are considered.\n\nIt is noteworthy that the variations in PFO in various types of athletes and football players are considerable (Randell et al. 2016). However, different playing position in football has different work requirements, thus it might be that some of the variation seen in PFO could be related to the different playing position.\n\nTo our knowledge, no study has previously looked at the variations in fat oxidation capacity before and after a training period in athletes. Therefore, the aim of the present study is to investigate changes in peak fat oxidation and aerobic fitness during a pre-season training period in sub-elite football players. A secondary aim is to investigate if the changes are related to specific playing positions on the field. The overall hypothesis is that a pre-season training period would increase the fat oxidation capacity and aerobic fitness, and that the changes are related to specific player positions."

            "Obesity is considered a chronic disease that increases the risk of developing diseases that reduce life expectancy. The treatment of obesity is complex. However, treatments based exclusively on dietary changes have not shown long-term efficacy especially in people with severe obesity. In contrast, in this group of people bariatric surgery (BS) has shown good long-term results in weight loss and maintenance. These changes are accompanied by significant improvements in health, improved quality of life, and reduced mortality. However, the changes in the digestive system created by BS and the high level of dietary restriction, affect the nutritional status and require a proper supplementation of vitamins and minerals during the follow-up. Intense weight loss during the first few months, coupled with an insufficient amount of protein in the diet, can lead to a loss of muscle mass. Excessive muscle loss during the short-term period can lead to functional repercussions (decreased strength and physical function) and reduced calories that the body burns daily. Naturally, this is especially important in people suffering from sarcopenia before BS, and it occurs more frequently in postmenopausal women. Despite this is known, specific protein intake recommendations after BS have not yet been defined based on scientific evidence. In this context, the first part of our proposal will assess the effect of two levels of protein supplementation: standard (S-PS) versus high (H-PS) on changes in a) body composition, b) energy expenditure, c) metabolic flexibility d) the physical condition during weight loss that follows BS. In addition, in patients with H-PS, the added effect of a physical exercise program, carried out with a personal trainer (professional of sports medicine trainer) virtually, will be evaluated. Protein supplementation and the virtual exercise program will be done during the 4 months following BS, and the results will be studied at 4, 8, and 12 months. Once the results have been defined, it is essential to transfer the recommendations to the real world. In a second part, and to achieve knowledge transfer to clinical practice, the investigators will explore the key elements that influence patient experience (XPA)."

The study aims to explore the integration of technology-assisted rehabilitation, utilizing wearable sensors and mobile health technologies, for unsupervised, real-world assessments. The use of digital biomarkers collected from these technologies offers continuous, objective measurements of patients' biological and physiological data. The research employs a dataset from moveUP digital therapies, including patients who underwent total knee arthroplasty, utilizing a digital application for at least six weeks post-surgery.\n\nKey objectives include evaluating the potential of automated unsupervised assessments in providing a holistic understanding of patient progression during rehabilitation. The study utilizes mixed models for statistical analysis, examining outcomes such as steps per day, 6-minute walk test, and peak 1 minute.

            "Cystic fibrosis (CF) is the UK s most common inherited genetic condition and affects more than 10,500 people. The disease causes problems with the movement of salt and water in the body, resulting in sticky mucus building up, mostly in the lungs and gut. Thick mucus in the airways leads to repeated infections which, over time, damage the lungs. Chest physiotherapy is prescribed to loosen and clear sticky thick mucus from the airways and so to help to reduce lung infection. Chest physiotherapy is a routine treatment to keep people with CF healthy. However, many say it is time-consuming and a burden. People with CF have asked if doing exercise could have the same effect as chest physiotherapy sessions for helping clear mucus. Exercise could be more enjoyable and less burdensome. Through a recognised priority setting partnership, the CF community recently ranked research to reduce the burden of their care and answer whether exercise can replace chest physiotherapy , as their number 1 and 7 priorities. Surveys show that many people with CF have occasionally chosen to replace chest physiotherapy with exercise for airway clearance, and we recently confirmed this through a UK-wide survey. It is not known if they would be willing to take part in research that asks some to stop chest physiotherapy and to exercise (with coughs and huffs) instead. New medicine (modulators) have recently become available for many people with CF, bringing dramatic improvements in their health. Some people who have started modulators are considering whether they can reduce or stop treatments - including chest physiotherapy. So, the effects of stopping chest physiotherapy need to be investigated and also if exercise can be used instead - this research study aims to understand this. A recent survey in people with CF, their families, physiotherapists and doctors, conducted by this research team, showed us that many consider hard exercise with coughs and huffs to be able to clear mucus from the airways. This study will recruit 50 people with CF (\\>12 years old) for 28-days. This study will ask half of them to continue their usual care, and half to stop chest physiotherapy and do exercise that gets them breathing deeply (with coughs and huffs) instead. This study will see if people are willing to start and continue with such a study and what they think of the study processes. It will also see how stopping chest physiotherapy and replacing it with exercise affects measurements of their lung function. The study will also involve talking with people with CF and members of their CF team to understand their experiences. This information will reveal whether a larger study can answer the question of whether certain forms of exercise can safely be used as an alternative to chest physiotherapy."

            "Background: Preschoolers' lifestyles have become physically inactive and sedentary, their eating habits unhealthy, and their sleep routines increasingly disturbed. Parental involvement appears to be crucial to combat unhealthy lifestyle of preschoolers. Because of recognized barriers of traditional face-to-face interventions (such as time commitment for parents), easy access and lower costs make electronic health (eHealth) interventions appealing. Previous studies that examined the effectiveness of parent-based eHealth on preschooler's (physical activity) PA, dietary behaviors (DB), and sleep have either emphasized on one variable or failed to balance the dosage of PA, diet, and sleep modules or consider the intervention sequence during the intervention period and there is an acknowledged gap in parent-based eHealth interventions which target preschoolers raised in Chinese cultural contexts.\n\nObjective: This study aims to investigate the effectiveness of parent-based eHealth intervention on Chinese preschoolers' PA, DB, and sleep problems.\n\nMethods: This two-arm parallel randomized controlled trial comprises a 12-week intervention with a 12-week follow-up. 206 parent-child dyads will be randomized to either eHealth intervention group or control group. Participants allocated to the eHealth intervention will receive 12 interactive modules on PA, DB, and sleep, with each module rot on a weekly basis to reduce the sequence effect on variable outcomes. The intervention is grounded upon Social Cognitive Theory and will be delivered through social media, where parents can obtain valid and updated educational information, social rapport, and interact with other group members and facilitators. Participants in the control group will receive weekly brochures on PA, DB, and sleep recommendations from the kindergarten teachers, but they will not receive any interactive components. Data will be collected at baseline, 3 months, and 6 months. The primary outcome will be the preschooler's physical activity. The secondary outcomes will be the preschooler's dietary behaviors, preschooler's sleep duration, and preschooler's sleep problems, parent's PA, parenting style, and parental feeding style.\n\nSignificance of this study: The parent-based eHealth intervention has potential to overcome the aforementioned barriers of face-to-face interventions, which will offer a novel approach for promoting healthy lifestyle of preschoolers. If found to be efficacious, the prevalence of unhealthy lifestyles among preschoolers may be alleviated at a low cost, which not only has a positive influence on the health of the individual and the well-being of the family but also reduces the financial pressure on society to treat diseases caused by poor lifestyle habits."

            "Aging is associated with a decline in muscle mass, strength, and physical function, leading to muscle mass loss and weakness. These concerns can impact an individual's functional independence and quality of life (QOL). Dietary protein stimulates muscle protein growth. Current studies suggest that optimal protein intake for older adults is greater than the Recommended Dietary Allowance. Barriers to consuming protein-rich foods in older adults include reductions in taste and smell, dentition, dexterity, and changes in living situation. Therefore, nutritional interventions are needed to effectively improve eating behaviors, diet quality, and stimulate muscle growth and strength. These interventions will help prevent, manage, and promote muscle mass loss recovery. Older adults may not be aware of their changing nutrient needs and therefore may lack the skills to prepare nutritionally adequate foods properly. Cooking demonstrations, or culinary medicine (CM), can help teach healthy cooking to reduce potential red meat consumption barriers and improve community-dwelling older adults' dietary habits. Thus, CM can be a novel strategy to improve diet quality in older adults and promote and augment at-home cooking. CM is an evidenced-base field that combines skills of preparing, cooking, and presenting food with the science of medicine. This field can help to accomplish potential eating behaviors and health outcome improvements. A tailored CM program can be an effective strategy that could reduce barriers in protein intake that will enable older adults to age well and productively."

To date, there is no ecological model in France explaining this behaviour in the post-treatment phase of breast, colorectal, prostate, and lung cancers. From this initial model, we seek to design an educational and motivational intervention in PA.\n\nThus, the investigators propose to test the feasibility of implementing an individualized program to increase and maintain level of physical activity and to decrease sedentary behaviours in physically inactive cancer survivors.

More than 40% of the Danish patients will never undergo surgery. Frail and immunodeficient older patients are at higher risk of complications, and immunomodulating treatment as chemotherapy results in different outcomes in comparable patients. No accurate validated screening tool to identify frail and immunodeficient OC women exists. Optimization through comprehensive geriatric assessment (CGA) and physical training before and during treatment may improve outcomes and decrease associated risks.\n\nAim: Primary endpoints will be to determine whether a CGA and physical training vs standard of care can increase the proportion of patients later on referred to interval debulking surgery, and examine the performance of validated screening tests in predicting impairments in CGA. Other endpoints will be to evaluate if intervention can improve completion of chemotherapy, to examine the association between frailty screening scores and selected biomarkers with treatment outcomes, including complications and quality of life, and ultimately to develop an improved frailty screening tool based on known screening tools, functional tests and biomarkers identifying patients who will benefit from CGA.\n\nMethod: This is a nationwide, randomized intervention study. Patients \u226570 years diagnosed with primary OC at the Gynecological departments of Rigshospitalet, Odense and Roskilde University Hospitals will be included. In an interdisciplinary collaboration between medical specialists in oncology, gynecology and geriatrics, included patients will be screened for frailty using validated screening tools and functional tests. Specific biomarkers and immunologic profile will be assessed in all patients. Patients selected for neoadjuvant chemotherapy will be randomized to receive CGA or standard of care. Patients selected for primary debulking surgery or palliation will be followed in an observational cohort.\n\nPerspective: The development of a validated screening tool for frailty assessment and immunological status will help us identify frail patients who may need optimization before treatment, resulting in more patients getting optimal treatment (either surgery or chemotherapy), prevent post-treatment complications and avoid palliative patients from undergoing a redundant complex treatment."

Heart disease, Diabetes mellitus, and hypertensive diseases are among the top 10 leading causes of death in Taiwan in 2021. Although 81.6% of Taiwanese participants in a 2022 nationwide survey responded that they exercised regularly, the Health Promotion Administration stated that 50.3% of the population from 2017-2020 is overweight or obese, up from 32.7% in 1993-1996. The intention-behavior gap in habit formation is difficult to overcome for most, especially when self-motivation is the biggest factor. Gamification, the use of game elements in non-game settings, and game elements can be used to lower the bar necessary for individuals to develop healthier daily habits.\n\nAim: This study aims to investigate the effects of applying gamified elements on the daily lives of university students in Taiwan to increase their daily step count as compared to their baseline and the control group, along with changes in certain health indicators, overall physical activity, sleep behavior \\& quality, and mental health, whether combining gamified elements is more effective than implementing gamified elements individually, and if implicit or explicit gamification is more effective.\n\nMethods: 300 participants will be recruited and, after providing informed consent, randomized into four groups: (1) Control, (2) Individual Gamified Elements Group (IGG), (3) Combined Gamified Elements Group (CGG), and (4) Explicit Gamification Group (EGG). Control group participants will add the official LINE account, submit weekly summaries of their DSC and to complete the three questionnaires. IGG, CGG, and EGG participants will be asked to add the official LINE account, download Google Fit onto their smartphone, establish a baseline for the first seven days, then set a Daily Step Count Goal (DSG) of an increase of 25%, 33%, or 50% on Day 7 of the study. IGG and CGG participants will then engage in various interventions, including Nudging (Week Two), and gamified interventions, including Points, Badges, \\& Leaderboards (PBLs) (Weeks Three \\& Four), Social Aspects (Weeks Five and Six), and Personalized Avatar \\& Progression via Explicit Gamification (Weeks Seven \\& Eight). IGG participants will engage with the multiple forms of gamified elements separately throughout the experiment, while CGG participants will slowly combine gamified elements as the experiment progresses (i.e. Week 2 Nudging, Week 3 Nudging + Points, Week 4 Nudging + Points + Leaderboard, etc.). EGG Participants will play Pikmin Bloom, which includes various gamified elements, for the duration of the study (8 weeks). Participants will complete the questionnaire at three points: the beginning of the experiment (initial check-in), the end of the experiment (8 weeks), and at follow-up (twelve weeks). The primary aim will be to determine whether or not the implementation of gamified elements will lead to an increase in overall DSC from baseline to 8 and 12 weeks, along with a certain percentage of patient-days that self-set DSGs are met at 8 and 12 weeks, as compared to the control group. Secondary outcomes include: how increasing participants' DSC will affect their health indicators, physical activity, mental health, and sleep behavior \\& quality, comparing the effectiveness of combined gamified elements vs. individual gamified elements in increasing participants' DSC, and if implicit or explicit gamification is more effective at increasing DSC."

            "Accuracy of a Mobile Sensor-Based System for the Detection of Chemotherapy Toxicity in Older Adults With Cancer in a Developing Country",
            "Patients with cancer in developing countries face considerable challenges in obtaining access to care due to a lack of human resources and infrastructure. This is particularly pressing for vulnerable populations such as older adults. In this setting, many patients receiving chemotherapy are unable to report the presence of toxicities, and adverse events can go unnoticed for considerable amounts of time. The goal of this study is to assess the accuracy of an objective patient-centered measure of physical function (the number of steps taken per day measured using an accelerometer-equipped smartphone) for the remote detection of chemotherapy toxicity in older adults. This study builds on a pilot trial showing that monitoring older patients remotely utilizing an accelerometer-equipped smartphone is feasible and acceptable, and that a decline in the number of steps detected using the device can be an early sign of chemotherapy toxicity. The hypothesis of this study is that a decline in the number daily steps from a prechemotherapy baseline, measured using an accelerometer-equipped smartphone, will be accurate for detecting chemotherapy toxicity in older adults with cancer. This study will evaluate the ability of a patient-centered measure (a decline in the number of daily steps compared with a pre-chemotherapy baseline) to identify the presence of clinically-significant chemotherapy-related toxicity in Mexican older adults with cancer starting first line chemotherapy. Patients will be provided with an accelerometer-equipped smartphone with an installed pedometer application. Baseline steps per day will be obtained and recorded before starting chemotherapy. The patients' steps will be monitored daily for the first three chemotherapy cycles and compared with baseline recordings. Patients will be contacted daily and chemotherapy toxicity will be assessed by a physician. If significant toxicities are identified, the patient will be prompted to seek medical attention. The optimal cutoff point for detecting chemotherapy toxicity utilizing a decline in the number of daily steps will be chosen and validated. The adherence and satisfaction with the intervention will also be evaluated. This study could improve current methods and transform the way in which cancer care is delivered by demonstrating that a simple patient-centered measure obtained using a commercially available smartphone can aid in the accurate identification of clinically significant toxicities among a vulnerable population such as older adults with cancer."

            "Rationale of the study: Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is very common and the rate of women suffering from it expected to increase in the next years. It is associated with maternal and fetal morbidity and the risk is correlated to the patient's degree of glucose control which can be achieved through a change in lifestyle or medication. Several studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of mobile apps in improving obstetric outcomes in GDM. In addition, the LUMEN device is a breathing device that produces dietary and exercise recommendations based on CO2 levels and improves metabolic parameters in patients with type 2 diabetes. No work has been done on its effectiveness in treating GDM. Aims of the study: Comparison of metabolic outcomes in women with gestational diabetes, with or without the use of LUMEN app. Design: This will be an open label parallel group 1:1 randomized-controlled trial Methods: the investigators will recruit women diagnosed with GDM. The women will be randomized to the intervention arm that will use the LUMEN device and app or to the control arm that will use a free mobile tracking app. The women will be required to monitor their blood sugar levels daily and to have GDM follow-up in the feto-maternal outpatient clinic, as is customary in GDM. After the birth, the maternal and neonatal outcome will be recorded. Based on past research data, a recruitment of 170 is needed to demonstrate a 16.7% decrease in insulin use to balance diabetes, with \u03b1 = 0.05 and \u03b2 = 80."

All research activities will be online.\n\nParticipants will download a smartphone app called TTRU-Curtis AWARE and keep it active on their phone. The app will run in the background and collect participant data, including: screen unlocks, duration of time the screen is on; apps used; words typed (except passwords); duration and time of phone calls; estimated location (exact location is not collected); and movement, such as how many steps are taken in a day. All personally identifying information is automatically removed before the data is stored (including phone numbers, names, or locations described in messages).\n\nEach day, participants will receive a text with a link to a survey. They will answer questions about their mood, behavior, and substance use from the day before. This survey should take less than 5 minutes to complete.\n\nEvery 30 days, participants will complete a longer survey. They will answer questions about their personal relationships, risky behaviors, mood, substance use, and feelings. They can skip any questions they do not feel comfortable answering.

If untreated, the disease progresses from the mild and reversible form (i.e. gingivitis) that involves superficial gum only to the more severe and irreversible form (i.e. periodontitis) that involves loss of periodontal ligament and bone. Teeth will be lost eventually and significantly impairs the function and the oral health related quality of health. Moreover, periodontal disease has been strongly linked to the systemic diseases via centrally or local routes with significant health implications.\n\nPeriodontal disease is initiated by bacteria (plaque) adhere on tooth surfaces and the body defense by eliciting inflammatory response. The disease and associated inflammation is site-specific and the affected gum is manifested with the cardinal signs of inflammation such as redness (color), swelling (increased volume), edema (loss of surface characteristics) and bleeds easily. Dentists are trained to identify the disease sites by visual (redness and swelling) and by mechanical probing (bleeding). Traditionally these give rises to clinical gum indices showing the degree of inflammation and are important to the clinical monitoring and management of gum diseases.\n\nThe management of periodontal disease involves the removal of bacteria plaque by both dentists' tooth cleaning and maintained by patients' daily home-care. Home-care plaque removal has been shown by many studies to prevent and/or cease the development of periodontitis. However, most patients do not able to remove plaque effectively and it only takes few days for a health site to development inflammation. Professional monitoring and feedback are highly desirable but many patients only have monthly or even yearly appointment which is too late. Such \"non-compliance\" increase the treatment cost/time, patient discomfort and reduce treatment efficacy. Moreover, many patients do not receive regular dental checkup and they seek dentists when the gum problem becomes irreversible that complicated and expensive treatment such as tooth extraction and rehabilitation is required.\n\nThis study consists of 1) collecting the standardized clinical photography with clinical gum indices/ marked by an experienced clinician, 2) import into computer for training, and 3) longitudinally monitoring and analyze of gum condition in a group of gingivitis patients receiving gum treatment."

Serum hormone measurements and transvaginal ultrasound are more accurate at determining time of ovulation and fertile window, but are costly and inconvenient. Urine-based luteinizing hormone (LH) tests offer improvement. However, LH surge typically occurs 24 to 36 hours prior to ovulation, only capturing the later portion of the fertile window.\n\nA novel approach involves using electrical impedance to track compositional changes in cervical mucus, providing real-time, at-home data. The Kegg device (Lady Technologies Inc, San Francisco, CA, USA) is an intravaginal device that measures cervical mucus impedance to monitor fertility status. Previous studies show it has higher sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy compared to BBT alone in determining the ovulation window. This method offers a cost-effective and practical alternative for at-home fertility tracking.\n\nThe objectives of this study are to:\n\n1. evaluate the association between Kegg electrical impedance readings and cervical mucus observations with regard to determining fertility status; and\n2. compare the accuracy of Kegg electrical impedance readings with hormone urine strips in identifying the complete fertile window determined by cervical mucus observations."

Lower abdominal pain may be accompanied by vomiting, headache, back pain, diarrhea, fatigue, etc. Depending on the pathophysiology, dysmenorrhea is classified into two types: primary and secondary. Primary dysmenorrhea (PD) is menstrual pain associated with normal ovulatory cycles in the absence of pelvic pathology and a clear physiologic etiology and is most commonly seen in adolescents and young adults. There are numerous studies on PD in the literature, but there is still a lack of studies on which of the non-pharmacologically recommended exercise and other methods is more effective on dysmenorrhea symptoms, sleep and quality of life for individuals with this problem. Different exercise intensities may affect PD symptoms through different mechanisms. Moderate to high intensity exercise may reduce pain by increasing anti-inflammatory cytokines, whereas less intense exercise, such as yoga, affects pain levels by decreasing cortisol levels. The lack of research on which exercise training is more effective in PD individuals was considered as a limitation. In the light of this information, the aim of the investigators study is to compare the effects of different training techniques on dysmenorrhea symptoms, sleep and quality of life in PD treatment and to present the preferability of these techniques based on evidence."

In patients decreased function and decreased quality of life as well as chronic pain are strong burdens . Despite modern treatments like biological agents just 25% of the patients are at remission (2) . Besides the pharmacological treatment physical activity is known to be very important to gain disease control. A low physical activity is related to a higher disease activity and a high physical activity to better disease control. Until now there is no structured capture of the daily movements of patients with axial spondylarthritis in clinical practice. Our goal is to analyse the relationship between movement and disease activity and to implement concrete recommendations for movement in patients with axSpa.\n\nThe primary objective of the study is to investigate which type, frequency and intensity of movement are helpful in gaining and remaining disease control in patients with axSpa.\n\nMethods This monocentric longitudinal study recordes movement, sport and physical parameters like heart frequency and heart rate variability through an observational period of 6 month via smartwatch. Meanwhile we record disease activity, pain and functional outcomes with regular surveys every two weeks. Patients in every phase of disease are eligible for inclusion, but they do must have an own iPhone due to software reasons. Data is collected in a specially programmed study-app. Fifty participants will be included in this study. Until now we have 24 patients included since april 2024. Patients come to clinic every 3 month as this is our standard in outclinic patients. We than do anamnesis and a physical examination. After the study period of 6 month we transmit the mobility and disease-related data of the surveys of the patients mobile device to our system.\n\nThe primary endpoint is to find exact recommendations for concrete movement in patients with axSpa.\n\nSo this is the first study that wants to give concrete recommendations for movement in patients with axSpa with the help of mobility tracking with smartwatches. This could help to prevent flares and also to recover quicker from a flare.\n\n1.

The Tobacco Treatment Guidelines underscore the need to offer patients who use tobacco products brief interventions that include prescriptions for proven pharmacological smoking cessation aids and proactive connections to evidence-based behavioral support. The rapid expansion of smart phone capabilities enhances the potential for tobacco cessation apps to personalize behavior change guidance and to send contextually relevant tailored behavior change nudges based on readiness to quit and electronic heath record (EHR) data. Rich data from EHRs are now available to third-party apps from the Health app (iOS) via Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources standard Application Programming Interface (API).\n\nThis Phase I Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) explored the effects of one such innovative health IT solution. refresh is a highly individualized tobacco cessation HealthKit enabled app that 1) implemented a full range of best practices in tailored health behavior change communications based on readiness to change; 2) provided individualized behavior change guidance based on Health app data; and 3) concisely provided data and documentation of key actionable insights in the EHR on the patient's smoking status, app usage, and brief micro-message delivered by clinicians to reinforce and accelerate a patient's behavior change progress. This interoperability provided value to both patients and clinicians; empowered and supported successful and lasting behavior change; and enabled the implementation and evaluation of a best-in-class approach to tobacco and nicotine treatment.\n\nExtensive end user and stakeholder input ensured that refresh was designed for rapid dissemination. Patients of an integrated delivery system with an upcoming appointment (n=51) were recruited to participate in a 30-day pilot test. Pre-post comparisons of Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) measure for tobacco (psychosocial expectancies) and confidence for quitting provided preliminary data on the effects of the program.

            "Mental health disorders are one of the most challenging chronic conditions to identify, treat and manage. This is largely due to the fact that diagnoses are almost entirely based on the patient's recall of current and past subjective experiences of symptoms; and then further interpreted by a healthcare professional introducing multiple layers of information biases in the formulation of a diagnosis. Accordingly, mental health conditions remain prevalent with high rates of misdiagnosis, inappropriate treatment and delayed intervention. In light of the heterogeneity across and within mental health conditions, a personalized interventional approach holds merit, yet the tools to effectively track an individual's day to day objective and subjective experience needed to achieve an individualized care approach have not until recently existed.\n\nDigital technologies such as passive and active sensing from smartphones and from wearable devices are shedding light on the capabilities of tracking new objective measures of health that could translate to key symptoms of mental health conditions. 'Multimodal data' approaches are those that attempt to translate a variety of electrical signals from digital devices to relevant health outcomes. The combination of digital devices to detect multimodal measures of mental health symptoms offers a unique opportunity to take a ground up approach in understanding the fluidity of mental health symptoms occurring at the individual level that might lend insight into new phenotypes of mental health illnesses that could have a physiological underpinning.\n\nThe Study Investigators aim to characterize the multiplexing and fluid nature of mental health symptoms across individuals experiencing mental health symptoms and conditions using digital tools (i.e., wearables and mobile apps) and additional context information collected from virtual study support calls.\n\nThe Investigators hope to know how objective measures from sensor data translate to core symptoms, episodes and flares across mental health disorders, and develop new (or new applications of) machine learning anomaly detection approaches and determine whether anomalies in expected symptom portraits can be reliably detected and enhanced by the addition of objectively measured data."

            "Virtual Reality(VR) has had promising applications in science and medicine, including intervention delivery. The use of VR interventions has been studied in a wide range of medical conditions, including anxiety, phobias, obesity, chronic pain, and eating disorders. VR based simulation in pediatrics has grown rapidly in recent years and is expected to continue to grow. VR technology has become increasingly affordable, flexible, and portable, enabling its use in a broad range of environments including the outpatient clinical setting. Additionally, children are believed to have an inclination toward games of \"pretend\" or alternate realities further indicating the potential of this technology. While immersed in a game, they often become deeply absorbed and able to ignore aversive stimuli. VR is an engaging intervention that may help to detract from pain and anxiety for children undergoing painful procedures. Heart rate has been used as a means to objectively quantify the physiologic response to pain and anxiety.\n\nThe purpose of the study is to conduct a randomized controlled study that assess the utility of Virtual Reality simulations compared to non immersive visual distraction in pediatric patients undergoing outpatient procedures including cast removal and surgical suture/pins removal. Primary outcomes will include changes in patient heart rate (an age-validated surrogate for pain and anxiety) and patient-reported changes in anxiety and pain.

One of the complications of a lateral ankle sprain is the development of chronic ankle instability (CAI). Conservative treatment is the initial therapeutic option for patients with CAI, however, the best strategies are not yet clear. Clinically, a new invasive technique has appeared, known as echoguided Percutaneous Neuromodulation (EPNM). To date there are no studies showing the efficacy of the technique in patients with CAI together with the combination of a neuromuscular exercise program.\n\nParticipants: Volunteers and adults, from the group of students of the Gimbernat University School with a history of ankle sprain and physically active who meet the inclusion criteria.\n\nStudy variables: Self-administered ankle function scales (Cumberland ankle instability tool: CAIT and foot and ankle ability:FAAM measure Scale), objective measurement of function in the lower limb (Test countermovement jump: CMJ and Side hop Test:SHT), measurement of isometric strength of the ankle musculature, measurement of dynamic balance (Test star excursion balance), range of motion measurement (Ankle Dorsiflexion) and pain measurement (Numeric pain rating scale: NPRS Scale).\n\nProcedures: After carrying out the assessment, the participants will be randomized to participate in a neuromuscular exercise intervention (control group) or in a neuromuscular exercise intervention together with an application of EPNM in the common peroneal nerve (control group). experimental).

Beat-to-beat variation of light-absorbance can be used to estimate the change in the arterial blood volume underneath the skin and different vital signs including the blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate and oxygen saturation (SpO2) of the patient.\n\nThe investigators propose an observational prospective study to independently evaluate the accuracy of contactless vital sign measurements using a cell phone-based remote photoplethysmography (rPPG) technology. This study will recruit adult patients presenting to the Accident and Emergency Department (A\\&E) of Queen Mary Hospital (QMH) between 1 August 2024 and 30 October 2024. The study will be divided into 2 stages. In the initial run-in period, the investigators will collect facial video data from 200 patients to calibrate the VitalsTM system in the A\\&E environment. Then, the investigators will evaluate the accuracy of the VitalsTM in estimating vital signs of 1,000 ambulatory patients in the A\\&E setting.\n\nA trained research nurse and research assistant will be deployed from 09:00 to 17:00 on weekdays to screen for eligible patients in the A\\&E waiting hall and to recruit patient participants throughout the study period. In this study, the investigators will only recruit triage category 3 (semi-urgent) to 5 (non-urgent) patients who are clinically stable and evaluate the performance of the VitalsTM in a designated room in A\\&E. Written informed consent will be obtained from all patient participants after an explanation of the details of the study, including the rationale, benefits and risks of participation.\n\nAfter informed consent, contactless and manual measurement of patient blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate, body temperature and SpO2 will be carried out simultaneously in a designated room in A\\&E. A mounted light emitting diode (LED) will be used as the light source. Facial video of the patient participant will be captured using an iPhone, an iPad and a thermal camera placed at around 50 cm from the patient. A reference object for thermal and visual imaging will be placed at the background. Also, ambient temperature and light intensity will be measured.\n\nThe patient will be asked to sit down and remain still during video-recording. Manual measurement will be performed simultaneously by a trained research nurse or research assistant using standard hospital device or other medical-grade devices. A software program will be used to log vital sign measurements and recordings simultaneously so that data can be synchronised to reduce variations.\n\nThe primary outcome is the accuracy of the VitalsTM platform in estimating patient heart rate measured in intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC). The investigators will also measure of accuracy of the VitalsTM platform in estimating other vital signs, including blood pressure, respiratory rate, SpO2 and body temperature. The investigators will also evaluate patient satisfaction and comfort with the contactless and manual measurement techniques.\n\nThe accuracy of contactless measurement will be determined by calculating the ICC from the manual measurement readings as the ground truths. The investigators will also calculate the root mean square error (RMSE) and Pearson correlation between the contactless and manual measurement readings for individual vital signs. Altman Bland plot will be used to evaluate the bias and limits of agreement between two vital sign measurement methods."

            "Hypertension (HTN) is the most important stroke and cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factor. Unfortunately, there is substantial under-treatment of HTN. Of the 86 million adults with prevalent HTN in the U.S., 40 million (46%) have inadequately controlled blood pressure (BP). This problem is worse among minority groups. In this study, the investigators demonstrate how mHealth (mobile health technology) can improve HTN control rates in stroke survivors and primary care patients without stroke, but who are at a high risk of stroke and CVD. Our intervention is called mGlide. Intervention participants will self- monitor their BP daily using a wireless BP monitor and a smart phone. The phone will transmit this BP to a database automatically. The investigators will use the framework of glide paths to manage the transmitted BP data. The glide path, based on the concept of landing an airplane, establishes an expected trajectory of BP readings for each patient with bounds set by guidelines and provider input. BP is monitored at home; the health care team is alerted when patient BP deviates from expected bounds. Alerts are generated once a week for the health care team with a list of patients with uncontrolled HTN. This facilitates early intervention while avoiding information overload. Partnering clinical centers include Federally Qualified Health Centers that serve low income and minority (Latino, African American, Hmong) communities. In this RCT study, the investigators will randomize 450 participants with uncontrolled HTN to the mGlide intervention (n=225) vs. state-of-clinical-care comparison (n=225)."

Compared to other racial/ethnic groups, AIANs have 6 times higher rates of developing smoking-related cancers, including lung cancer. Commercial cigarette smoking accounts for half of all deaths among AIANs nationwide. AIANs' often lack of access to smoking cessation interventions, which may be due to inequities in the healthcare system, lack of health insurance, living in rural areas, systemic racism, and historical trauma. There is also a lack of effective smoking cessation interventions for AIANs. Smartphone apps have the potential to deliver a low-cost smoking cessation intervention with wide reach to AIANs. Apps require no in-person delivery and no provider training, do not require integration into complex hospital systems, can be freely accessed on an app store, and are available at any time and any place. iCanQuit is a behavioral intervention designed to help adults stop smoking by teaching skills for coping with smoking urges, staying motivated, and preventing relapse. The iCanQuit app intervention may be more effective than the currently available NCI QuitGuide app at helping AIANs quit smoking."

            "The proposed studies will test this hypothesis by randomizing patients with AF to 2-HOBA or placebo 7 days prior to AF ablation to allow 2-HOBA to reach steady-state levels. We hypothesize that tissue injury from AF ablation causes a large release of ROS that react with lipids to generate IsoLGs (Figure 2). In the absence of 2-HOBA, IsoLGs will react within seconds to form IsoLG-macromolecule adducts in atrial tissue, promoting early recurrence of AF. In the presence of 2-HOBA, IsoLGs will rapidly react to form IsoLG-macromolecule adducts in atrial tissue, promoting early recurrence of AF. In the presence of 2-HOBA, IsoLG will preferentially bind to and therefore be inactivated by 2-HOBA thereby sparing injury to the atrial tissue caused by oxidative stress and its contribution to early recurrence of AF. Early recurrence of AF will be measured by ECGs that are recorded once per day by a smartwatch (Apple Watch, Apple Inc., Cupertino, CA) with additional ECGs recorded by the participant if they experience symptoms of AF, or if the smartwatch alerts the participant of a possible AF episode via its auto-detection AF monitoring algorithm. The Apple Watch's AF algorithm is based on sampling of heart rate and variability and will give an audible alarm if those parameters indicate a possible episode of AF. The smartwatch records a single-lead ECG if the participant touches the watch with their contralateral hand. The day and time of the episode is also stored by the smartwatch. At the end of the 28-day follow-up period, study personnel will review the stored ECGs. Blood will be drawn prior to ablation and on post-procedure Day 1 for measurement of IsoLG-adduct levels. DNA will be extracted to explore a pharmacogenomic interaction with haplotypes at the chromosome 4q25 AF risk locus, which: 1) is strongly associated with the development of AF and the early recurrence of AF after ablation27; and 2) has been reported to be a regulator of an anti-oxidant gene program in response to cardiac injury."

Approximately 20 % of Danish adolescents report a history of NSSI at some point in their lives. Individuals with NSSI have an increased risk of suicidality. Therefore, it is of great importance to develop and investigate the effectiveness of a low-cost app in reducing NSSI.\n\nThe purpose is to investigate whether treatment as usual (TAU) and the Zero Self-Harm app is superior to TAU in reducing 1) frequency of NSSI-episodes and 2) suicide ideation, and depressive symptoms in individuals with NSSI. As people with NSSI, without a comorbid psychiatric diagnosis, are not eligible to receive psychiatric treatment in Denmark, TAU includes many different treatments and counseling services, i.e. counseling at non-profit organizations, service centers in the municipalities, outpatient treatment services for psychiatric disorders, and care, information and attention at emergency departments. Common to them all is that they do not offer specialized treatment focused on NSSI.\n\nThe trial is designed as a 2-arm, parallel group, 6 months, randomized clinical superiority trial. A total of 280 participants, 140 in each arm, will be included. One group will receive TAU, the other will receive TAU and the Zero Self-Harm App. Participants will be recruited through non-profit organizations, service centers in the municipalities, outpatient treatment services, and psychiatric and somatic emergency departments in Denmark.\n\nInclusion criteria are engagement in two or more episodes of NSSI in the past month, no further planned treatment, have a smartphone, fluent in Danish, provide an informed written consent, age above 18 years."

Lymphedema is a very common result of breast cancer and its treatment. Lymphedema is the build-up of fluid in tissues, which results in tissue swelling. The lymph system is a network of lymph vessels, tissues, and organs that carry extra fluid from your cells/tissues throughout the body. If this lymph fluid is not able to flow in the body how it should, there will be swelling which can lead to lymphedema. It can be classified into stages 0 to 3 depending on the severity of the condition. Stages 0 and 1 are reversible, and through early diagnosis and treatment, the recovery to the normal volume and normal skin status of arms can be possible. On the other hand, stage 2 or higher is irreversible, and tissue fibrosis progresses and cannot return to normal skin; therefore, it is important to detect early and start treatment.\n\nThis is an observational longitudinal study. Potential participants will be recruited for follow-up after breast cancer surgery. Only patients who fit the inclusion criteria will be considered for participation in the study and contacted by the healthcare provider.

            "The ability to successfully integrate information across sensory systems is a vital aspect of functioning in the real world. To date, only a few studies have investigated the clinical translational value of multisensory integration processes. Previous work has linked the magnitude of visual-somatosensory integration (measured behaviorally using simple reaction time tasks) to important cognitive (attention) and motor (balance, gait, and falls) outcomes in healthy older adults. While multisensory integration effects have been measured across a wide array of populations using various sensory combinations and different neuroscience approaches, a gold standard for quantifying multisensory integration has been lacking. The investigator recently developed a step-by-step protocol for administering and calculating multisensory integration effects in an effort to facilitate innovative and novel translational research across diverse clinical populations and age-ranges. However, patients with severe medical conditions and/or mobility limitations often experience difficulty traveling to research facilities or joining time-demanding research protocols. Using the aforementioned protocol, the study team invented a mobile multisensory falls-assessment iPhone app called CatchU to facilitate physician discussion and counseling of falls in older adults during clinical visits (e.g., annual wellness visits with a subsequent telehealth call), in an attempt to alleviate disability, promote independence, and increase quality of life for older adults. The investigator team has provided a cross-sectional research proposal for a pilot study of 300 patients (over a 24-month period) in order to demonstrate acceptable-to-excellent predicative accuracy of CatchU for identifying older adults at-risk for falls."

Novel, innovative approaches are urgently needed to provide support for Indigenous youth in Northwestern Ontario. In partnership with Dilico Anishinabek Family Care, the investigators are evaluating the impact of a mental health app (JoyPop) as a tool for Indigenous transitional-aged youth who are waiting for mental health services. The JoyPop app was developed to support improved emotion regulation - a key difficulty for youth presenting with mental health challenges.

            "Emergency Medicine (EM) requires 24/7 staff coverage resulting in healthcare workers' circadian rhythm disruptions that impair clinical and cognitive performance, physical recovery, and contribute to burnout. Multiple well-being surveys continue to highlight EM's challenges with sleep impairment due to the nature of the specialty. Despite evidence that lifestyle strategies effectively optimize performance and recovery, EM residents have variable lifestyle choices to prepare for overnight shifts. This prospective randomized controlled trial will examine whether a pre-shift personalized fatigue-mitigation lifestyle coaching (PFMLC) for EM residents on overnight shifts minimizes the effects of circadian rhythm disruptions on performance and recovery compared to those who receive one-time passive information on lifestyle practices. All participants will receive lifestyle strategy materials on fatigue mitigation to improve performance. Residents' self-reported and biometric data will inform PFMLC in the active arm. Performance and recovery from night shifts will be assessed by changes in sleep, heart rate variability, readiness/recovery, alertness, cognitive performance, and mental health using Fitbit and validated measures."

These challenges can negatively impact the quality of life for these children. Therefore, it is essential to seek effective treatments that help improve these skills.\n\nThe use of technology in treatments, especially with games that utilize augmented reality (AR), has proven to be a good strategy. This technique aids motor learning, improving the skills that children struggle with while also increasing motivation, allowing them to engage in activities they enjoy. However, the application of AR in children with CP is still limited.\n\nIn this context, it is crucial to provide appropriate treatments for these children, harnessing the benefits of AR technology. This study aims to investigate the effects of a protocol called \"INTERACT protocol,\" which consists of training activities that interest children, such as reaching for objects and getting up from a bench. These activities are linked to AR games and will be conducted with accessible equipment for children with CP, aiming to improve their quality of life.\n\nThe children selected for the research will be divided into two groups: the experimental group (INTERACT) and the control group. This division will be done by random draw. The children in the control group will continue receiving the physiotherapy they are already undergoing for the same duration as the children in the INTERACT group. All children will participate in the treatment for 4 weeks, three times a week, with sessions lasting 1 hour and 20 minutes each.\n\nOur hypothesis is that the children participating in the INTERACT protocol will show improvements in activities involving reaching for objects and in the transition from sitting to standing."

Endogenous CS has an estimated incidence of 0.2 to 5.0 cases per million per year and prevalence of 39 to 79 cases per million in various populations. CS usually affects young women, with a median age at diagnosis of 41.4 with a female-to-male ratio of 3:1. Following a curative surgery for CS, patients develop adrenal insufficiency and require GC replacement postoperatively until the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis recovery occurs. Factors, such as age, gender, BMI, subtypes of CS, duration of symptoms, clinical and biochemical severity and postoperative GC dose have been reported to affect the HPA recovery in small retrospective studies. Glucocorticoid withdrawal syndrome (GWS) is a withdrawal reaction due to decrease in supraphysiological GC concentrations, which occurs after a successful surgery of CS. Glucocorticoid withdrawal syndrome (GWS) is under-recognized entity in patients undergoing curative surgery for endogenous Cushing syndrome.\n\nIn this study we aim to determine pre- and post-surgical predictors of the duration and severity of glucocorticoid withdrawal in patients undergoing a curative surgery for cortisol excess and assess the effect of MUSE intervention on GWS severity in patients undergoing curative surgery for CS as compared to standard of care."

            "Wound healing is a complex process and wound care and evaluation is one of the most important problems in current medicine. Wounds are seen in clinics as diabetic foot ulcers (DFU), arterial and venous ulcers, pressure injuries, surgical wounds and so on. Pressure injuries (PI) have a high mortality rate (29%) among elderly individuals. The prevalence of PIs in different countries worldwide varies between 6% and 18.5% in acute care settings. Wound assessment is an integral part of nursing practice.\n\nImproper assessment of wounds may lead to inadequate wound care, resulting in delayed wound healing, increased risk of infection, increased costs, and decreased patient quality of life. Wound measurement is a useful quantitative finding in wound assessment, used as a practical approach to monitor wound healing. An ideal wound measurement method should be practical, comfortable for the patient, high accuracy, reliability and applicability. In clinical practice, it is essential to regularly reassess wounds to monitor changes in size, depth, and appearance over time.\n\nWith the emergence of new techniques and technologies, there is a need for methods that can be considered as the gold standard in the measurement of wound dimensions. It is seen in the literature that studies comparing two- and three-dimensional measurement methods are generally carried out on superficial wounds and very limited wound types. In addition, there are hardly any studies comparing depth measurements with three-dimensional methods. In this direction, it was necessary to conduct this study in order to create evidence-based data in the field. The research has the quality of being the first and original study in our country that evaluates the compatibility of innovative methods in the area measurement of PIs and measures the wound depth."

Hearing aids can help in these situations, but difficulties often remain in more challenging situations, for example, when a conversation is being held in a group or when background noise is present. These difficulties are often not only related to the hearing loss but also to how these sounds are processed in the brain. Auditory rehabilitation is believed to help persons with a hearing impairment train their listening and communication skills. Auditory rehabilitation includes sensory management to enhance auditory function; knowledge and skills to improve the outcome; perceptual training and counselling. For this reason, the ALICE app was developed. The ALICE app contains monitoring tests, listening training exercises and counselling for persons with a hearing impairment.\n\nIn the current study, the ALICE app will be evaluated by persons with a hearing impairment. The experimental group will use the ALICE app in addition to the standard of care (hearing aid or cochlear implant) while the control group will receive the standard of care.

            "Neck pain is one of the leading causes of disability worldwide and ranks fourth among the pathologies that result in disability. Although neck pain can be attributed to traumatic or inflammatory disorders, the majority of neck pain has no discernible cause and is considered idiopathic. Neck pain that lasts longer than 3 months takes the form of chronic neck pain. Some problems such as changes in muscle behavior and decrease in proprioceptive sensory input are observed in individuals with chronic neck pain. The presence of such problems, especially the dysfunction of the deep cervical muscles and the inability of the proprioceptors to provide motor control, cause the position sense to be impaired in these individuals and the awareness of the neck of the individuals decreases.\n\nThe Left Right Judgment Task (LRJT) is a form of implicit motor imagery that involves determining as accurately and quickly as possible whether an image of a body part belongs to the left or right side. LRJT performance differences have been hypothesized to reflect changes in central nervous system functioning, errors in judgment, and changes in bodily representations. It has been shown that LRJT is a complex mental task that includes cognitive, sensory, motor and behavioral processes and can be associated with them.\n\nRecent studies have revealed that neck pain causes proprioceptive disorder and that proprioceptive training should be done in these individuals. A study showed that there is a strong correlation between biasedness judgment accuracy and proprioception.\n\nIn this context, the investigators aimed to investigate the knowledge about the effect of individuals with neck pain on proprioception, cortical body diagram and pain."

When these pathways are deregulated, the proteic, lipidic and metabolic is affected.

A laser used for the micro-sampling of material in vivo,\n2. A transport transfer line of the ablated particles,\n3. A mass spectrometer that analyzes them in real time and generates the molecular profiles of the epidermis,\n4. A data analysis procedure.\n\nThe SpiderMass(TM) is of great interest for the study of the skin because it allows non-invasive vivo characterization, and therefore without biopsy or sample preparation. In addition, it will complement techniques already used in the research center such as FTIR spectroscopy. Indeed, in acne studies the FTIR allows to obtain only the Fatty Acid Triglycerid ratio while the SpiderMass permits to detail these lipid classes by each observed molecule on the surface of the skin and follow their evolution."

With advances and proliferation of mobile technology platforms, there is substantial interest in the possible use of mobile health (mHealth) interventions to address these challenges. Of the mHealth approaches under investigation for TB adherence monitoring, drug metabolite testing has been identified as the most promising, ethical, and accurate, and the least intrusive and stigmatizing strategy compared to other mobile solutions, yet its potential remains largely unexplored. Additionally, mobile applications (apps) may provide personalized treatment supervision, increase patients' self-management and improve patient-provider communication by offering more advanced functionalities for patient support and monitoring.\n\nThe existing version of the TB-TST app offers education on TB and its treatment, communication with a care-coordinator, tracks treatment adherence (both by self-reporting and direct metabolite test strip images), self-reports treatment side-effects, and retains patient's \"diary\" notes. This proposal builds on preliminary work to: 1) Refine the TB-TST intervention based on pilot study findings and apply principles of user-centered design; 2) Evaluate the impact of the TB-TST on treatment outcomes compared to usual care; 3) Assess patient and provider perceptions of the facilitators and barriers to implementation of the TB-TST and synthesize lessons learned with stakeholders and policy makers. Primary outcome will be treatment success. Secondary outcomes will include: treatment default rates, self-reported adherence, technology use and usability.

One of the most common cardiologic diseases at the age of 18-30 is benign heart rhythm disorder, which often does not require diagnosis or treatment and can be considered normal.\n\nThat said, notification of the detection of atrial fibrillation can affect psycho-emotional well-being, particularly anxiety.\n\nThis study will assess the level of psycho-emotional health (anxiety level) of the study participants. Participant observation will provide an opportunity to identify associations between the use of the ECG recording function on wearable devices and levels of anxiety and depression. It is hypothesized that the use of smartwatches with the ECG function activated will not lead to a change in anxiety levels on the GAD-7 scale among the study participants.

            "Alopecia areata (AA) is an immunologically mediated disease characterized by non-scarring hair loss (Madni and Shapiro, 2000). AA is presented by rapid and complete hair loss in one or more round or oval patches, usually on the scalp, beard area, eyebrows, eyelashes, and less commonly, on other hairy areas of the body (Berker et al., 2010 and James et al., 2011) Alopecia areata is a T-cell-mediated autoimmune disease. There is a complicated interplay between loss of immune privilege in the hair follicle, autoimmune-mediated hair follicle damage, and activation of inflammatory pathways that have been argued to explain the development of this disorder, but the exact pathophysiology of AA remains unknown. Hair follicles are infiltrated by autoreactive CD8 and CD4 T lymphocytes, which attack hair follicle-derived autoantigens while sparing the stem compartment (Rajabi et al., 2018).\n\nAlopecia areata can be treated with topical and/or intralesional corticosteroids, which are the treatment of choice. Anthralin, minoxidil, coal tar, and topical immunotherapy are examples of other topical treatments. Systemic immunosuppressants such as cyclosporine, systemic steroids, Janus kinase inhibitors, and methotrexate may be considered in severe resistant cases (lee and lee, 2017).\n\nIntralesional triamcinolone acetonide is preferred in cases of AA , as it is well known as anti-inflammatory and interferes with local immunity of the skin, which helps in the recovery of the disease, but if used in wrong technique or given in a high dose, it might cause all the side effects of corticosteroid, especially skin atrophy (Berker et al., 2010).\n\nLactic acid is a member of alpha-hydroxy acids. It has been used in the treatment of many skin diseases, like AA and vitiligo. Lactic acid stimulates spontaneous secretion of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) by human reconstructed epidermis. VEGF is an angiogenic cytokine involved in angiogenesis and wound healing and stimulates the growth of hair follicles resulting in recovery of AA. Other studies suggest that lactic acid may act through its irritant effect (Al-Tammimy, 2005).\n\nVitamin D interacts with the innate and adaptive immune systems in a variety of ways, the majority of which contribute to its downregulation (Nancy and Yehuda, 2009). It has a powerful effect on T and B lymphocytes, influencing their activation responses (Arnson et al., 2007).\n\nAll cells of the immune system express 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 receptors (VDRs) and are therefore vulnerable to calcitriol-mediated modulation. Vitamin D3 has the ability to influence the migration and maturation of different dendritic cell subtypes and their production of chemokines and cytokines, giving them an immunoregulatory and tolerogenic role (Illescas-Montes et al., 2019) It has been shown that VDRs are highly expressed in the keratinocytes of human hair follicles and the absence of their expression is associated with reduced hair follicle growth and epidermal differentiation. Reduced VDR expression in the hair follicles of affected areas has also been observed in studies of AA patients' scalp (\u00c7erman et al., 2015).\n\nMicroneedling (MN) is a technique that comprises puncturing the skin repeatedly with sterile microneedles (Iriarte et al., 2017). It promotes hair regeneration by triggering stem cells in the hair bulge, which results in the generation of growth factors. It also improves blood circulation to the hair follicles and influences the local immune cells (Chandrashekar et al., 2014). Moreover, combining MN with applied topical drugs facilitates their absorption through the microchannels created within the epidermis (Fertig et al., 2018)."

            "A growing body of research implicates rumination as being a transdiagnostic risk factor involved in the development of depression and anxiety in youth. Critically, mindfulness meditation has shown significant promise in targeting rumination, and ultimately improving depressive and anxiety symptoms. Mindfulness apps offer a convenient and cost-effective means for accessing mindfulness training, while being interactive and engaging for youth. Despite their growing popularity among teens, strikingly little research has been conducted on these apps. Two critical questions have yet to be addressed: (1) what are the underlying neural and cognitive mechanisms that account for the beneficial effects of these apps and (2) for whom is app-based mindfulness well-suited. To address these gaps, adolescents (ages 13-18) will be randomly assigned to an app-delivered mindfulness course vs. a control condition and will complete pre- and post-intervention resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scans to probe static and dynamic functional connectivity within - and between - brain networks strongly implicated in mindfulness training and rumination. In addition, cognitive tasks will be administered at pre- and post-intervention to assess attentional control abilities putatively enhanced by mindfulness training. Finally, mindfulness skills and changes in rumination will be assessed via smartphone-based ecological momentary assessment (EMA). First, the investigators will test whether changes in (1) brain functional connectivity, (2) attentional control and (3) acquisition and use of mindfulness skills mediate between-group (i.e., app vs. control) differences in the reduction of rumination. Second, the investigators will test whether a machine learning model incorporating baseline clinical, demographic, and psychosocial characteristics can be used to identify which adolescents are predicted to benefit from app-based mindfulness training."

            "Reducing Opioid Use and Misuse After Wisdom Molar Extractions",
            "Reducing opioid prescription related use and misuse is a major focus for countering the national epidemic of opioid overdose and death. Annually, over 3.5 million predominantly young and healthy individuals undergo outpatient third molar ('wisdom tooth') tooth extractions under sedation and routinely receive postoperative opioid prescriptions. This procedure is among the most prevalent instances of opioid prescriptions dispensed to adolescents, a vulnerable population. This overuse can be minimized by bringing about immediate and sustained pain relief following extractions and by proper monitoring to regulate post-operative opioid usage.\n\nThe investigators developed the Twin block, a local anesthetic nerve block that rapidly eases pain from the 'closer' muscles of the jaw and showed its long-term effectiveness in patients with chronic jaw muscle pain. Administering the Twin block immediately following third molar extractions will be an innovative and effective modality to alleviate acute post-procedure pain experienced by the patient and hence reduce the need for post-operative opioid pain medication.\n\nIn order to tightly regulate when, how many and to whom the prescribed opioid pill is accessible, this study will utilize the iPill Dispenser\u00ae, an active pill dispenser. The iPill device, designated as a Class I 510(k) exempt device by the FDA, includes an App that utilizes biometric user authentication to operate a portable tamper-resistant, pre-calibrated device to regulate, deliver, and monitor opioid usage for pain, preventing overconsumption and diversion. The investigators further plan to 'track' pill swallowing by encapsulating the medication with an ingestible event marker (IEMs, FDA approved Class II device). The hypothesis of this study is that reduction in opioid prescription and its unwarranted use following third molar extractions can be achieved by a combination of Twin block, an active pill dispenser and ingestion tracking. The Specific Aims are:\n\nSpecific Aim 1. Compare highest pain after third molar tooth extractions, in patients with and without the twin block.\n\nSpecific Aim 2. Compare postoperative opioid consumption during the first 4 days following third molar tooth extractions between patients who got the twin block, with those who do not. Using the iPill dispenser and app and the IEM, the investigators will track opioid consumption for severe pain."

            "The primary aim of the project is to test the efficacy of BCBT delivered via a digital platform (i.e., smartphone) to Servicemembers with recent suicidal ideation and/or suicide attempts presenting to primary care clinics. Given existing challenges of scaling empirically-supported treatments/interventions for suicidality with fidelity, this project could lead to markedly expanded access to BCBT, along with improving our understanding about what intervention strategies are most effective and how they can be delivered with meaningful fidelity. Aviva, the digital version of BCBT, was developed for use with patients across the full spectrum of healthcare settings, including primary care. Aviva is not an emergency alert system, rather a digital platform for delivery of the full scope of BCBT treatment components. An open-label single group Phase I clinical trial has demonstrated the safety, tolerability, feasibility, fidelity, and potential efficacy of Aviva, with participants completing modules over 8 weeks, and follow-up assessments at weeks 1, 4, and 8. Subsequent refinements included the addition of technical features that would allow patients to revisit and/or repeat previously completed modules, along with integration of more characters for delivering video vignettes and greater opportunities for skills practice and treatment engagement. These modifications have further enhanced Aviva safety, tolerability, and fidelity, consistent with the original BCBT protocol. Not only is it hypothesized that Aviva will result in significantly larger reductions in severity of suicidal ideation than participants randomized to the control condition, but also that greater app engagement will be negatively correlated with severity of suicidal thinking. Moderators and mediators (i.e. suicidal beliefs, wish to live, impulsive decision-making) of intervention effects will also be examined. The study will be conducted at the primary care clinics at Fort Carson, with a goal of enrolling 720 patients across a two-year timeframe. Participants will be identified using each clinic's existing suicide risk assessment methods, including the PHQ-9 suicide risk item and a score of 1 or higher on the CSSRS Screener (Recent). Participants will be randomly assigned to one of two treatment conditions, Aviva or control (i.e., development of a safety plan consistent with local procedures and policies, along with referral for standard mental health care and suicide risk management in accordance with local policies and procedures). In an effort to address potential performance bias specific to smartphone use, participants in the control condition will download the Suicide Safety Plan app to their smartphones. Those in the Aviva condition will also complete weekly check-ins with Project 2 research clinicians to review treatment adherence, identify and respond to any logistical/operational problems, and respond to any unexpected emergencies and/or participant safety concerns. Participants will have up to five data points: baseline, 3, 6, 9, and 12 months.

The main questions this study aims to answer are:\n\n* Does living in a neighborhood with high or low vulnerability influence the response of the heart, lungs, and immune system to air pollution.\n* Does nutritional status alter the association between air pollution exposure and changes in the heart, lungs, and immune system.\n\nParticipants (age 25-70 years) that live in neighborhoods ranked high or low on the Social Vulnerability Index (SVI) will take part in 3 visits. Each visit involves the following:\n\n* Measurements of heart activity, lung function, and blood to measure changes that may be caused by air pollution.\n* Questionnaires about the types of food eaten and activities that may modify exposure to air pollution.\n* Estimation of air pollution exposure using a study iPhone. Participants will carry a study iPhone with them for 24 hours at each visit. The study iPhone runs an application (app) that estimates the amount of air pollution each participant is exposed to.\n* Wearing silicone wristbands for a week before each study visit. Silicone wristbands absorb air pollutants and are later measured see the types and amounts of chemicals participants are exposed to."

Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) has shown promise in bolstering mental health across diverse populations. Preliminary findings from a feasibility trial (NCT05803252) suggest the potential of FACT in this context.\n\nMethods: Expanding upon prior research, this definitive RCT compares FACT to standard parenting advice, correcting for earlier limitations through increased sample size and rigorous methodology. Assessments will be conducted at baseline, post-intervention (4-8 weeks), and 6-month follow-up.\n\nResults: The study anticipates that FACT will demonstrate superior outcomes in promoting well-being among parents compared to parenting advice alone.\n\nConclusion: By leveraging videoconferencing for therapy delivery, the RCT aims to improve access to mental health interventions and emphasize the importance of psychological health among parents of special needs children. This could foster greater recognition and proactive management of mental health within this population."

            "Neck pain is an important public health problem with a high lifetime prevalence and frequently occurring in all industrialized countries. Clinical practice guidelines for chronic neck pain recommend conservative management. Conservative treatment includes many approaches such as endurance, stretching and strengthening exercises, manual therapy, proprioceptive exercises, pilates and yoga. In patients with chronic neck pain, atrophy of deep neck muscles, deterioration in fiber type ratio, muscle tenderness and decreased range of motion are observed. These problems cause poor cervical postural control system and thus impaired sense of proprioception, loss of balance, decreased eye movement and cervical muscle activity. Sensorimotor control of upright posture and head-eye movement relies on information from the vestibular, visual, and proprioceptive systems that assemble throughout the central nervous system.The cervical spine has an important role in providing proprioceptive input. This role is associated with an abundance of cervical mechanoreceptors. Recent studies have shown that proprioceptive training is associated with cervical joint position sense, joint range of motion, pain and disability. Also yoga combines physical exercises with breathing techniques and meditation and yoga is one of the most commonly used complementary treatments for neck pain.The aim of study is to determine the effectiveness of exercises for sensorimotor structure and yoga exercises with physical and meditative effects in individuals with chronic neck pain."

            "The six-minute walk test (6MWT) is a standard method for measuring exercise capacity in patients with cardiopulmonary disease such as pulmonary hypertension (PAH) and measures how far a patient can walk in 6 minutes. The test is usually performed in the hospital, by walking along a hospital corridor. Since the outbreak of SARS-CoV-2, there has been a need to minimise patient contact with hospitals and their staff to reduce transmission of the virus. In a previous research project called 6APP, the investigators designed, developed and evaluated a mobile phone app, to allow them to perform the 6MWT in the community. Given the current circumstances, cardiovascular outpatients including patients in the PAH clinic at Oxford University Hospitals are being recommended to use an app derived from that project to provide their 6MWT distance to the clinical team for assessment, in addition to their symptoms and general well-being. This is felt to be more appealing to the patients, and would reduce the time spent in hospital on the day of their outpatient appointment.\n\nThe investigators plan to measure the usefulness of adopting remote, mobile-based 6MWT among hospital outpatients, within the constraints imposed by the SARS-COV2 pandemic."

PCPs have few evidence-based resources beyond antidepressant medication for treating elevated depressive symptoms, which results in negative outcomes for their depressed patients. Mobile technologies offer an ideal strategy to meet widespread treatment needs. The purpose of the proposed project is to\\\\ customize Behavioral Activation (BA), a straightforward, empirically supported treatment for elevated depressive symptoms, for a mobile format (Moodivate) in order to address the currently unmet needs of PCPs and their patients with elevated depressive symptoms."

            "Childhood obesity within the United States has been a growing concern over the past number of years, and if not addressed, leads to detrimental health outcomes for youth as they move into adulthood. The literature suggests that over-eating, especially when framed in terms of food addiction, plays a key role in this epidemic; however, treatment options are time intensive, posing a profound logistical barrier for both the child and parent and often limits or prevents engagement. As research within the field of mHealth has grown, technology-based interventions have gained traction, specifically interactive smartphone applications (apps). Displacement theory, although not new, has been understudied yet provides a strong explanation and treatment plan for addictive type behaviors. The core of this theory posits that problems which one feels they cannot face nor avoid leads to repetitive and irrepressible behaviors; however, if a healthy coping behavior can be learned and utilized, then the unhealthy behavior will cease. The theory lends itself well to being adapted into an mHealth format, making it more easily accessible and more widely used. Grounded in displacement theory, the proposed study aims to develop an app-based weight loss intervention for adolescents with obesity. Information gained regarding the feasibility and acceptability of such an intervention can potentially be replicated and applied to other populations with various addictive behaviors. Helping those with addictive behaviors in a format that has little to no logistical barriers can have a substantial impact on public health. A novel smartphone app will be designed by key stakeholders and refined through the course of the study. 46 total adolescents (14-18 years old) with %BMIp95 will be recruited via various sources (e.g., clinic referrals, flyers, social media advertising) to participate in one of two stages of the study: the beta testing stage or the trial stage. Beta testing will enroll two successive groups of eight teens to test the app for three weeks; participants will be assessed in-person pre- and post-intervention. After each group, the app will be modified to incorporate their feedback in order to promote youth engagement. The trial stage will enroll 30 adolescents to participate in a four-month intervention; participants will complete three assessments, baseline, post-intervention (both in-person) and one-month post-intervention (either in-person or virtually). The study will examine engagement and satisfaction with the app, as well as the intervention's impact on clinical outcome measures (weight and BMI, diet and snacking, and addictive behaviors related to food and substance use) and potential mediators/moderators (motivation for change, perceived stress, and distress tolerance)."

            "Infertility affects approximately 48 million couples and 186 million individuals globally, and it has biological, psychosocial, and economic problems in couples. It is a vital global reproductive health problem that has burdens and affects not only families but also society and the state.\n\nStudies indicate that many situations experienced during the infertility treatment process negatively affect the treatment results, and the anxiety of individuals receiving treatment, especially women, is high. The previous literature reports that during the infertility treatment process, women experience a decrease in their anxiety and self-confidence about drug administration, they have doubts about the dose, administration, and time of drugs, and the rate of mistakes made regarding drug administration is too high to be ignored. Such cases may lead to cycle cancellations in infertility treatment, interrupting the treatment, adversely affecting the success of the treatment, and thus exposing the couple to more than one treatment trial. The interruption of the treatment with the cycle cancellation, the increase in the number of treatment attempts, the repetitions cause the woman to be exposed to a higher amount of drug, the cost to increase with each treatment trial, an increase in the economic burden of the couples, and an increase in the financial burden for the country. In addition to these physical and economic burdens, feelings such as anxiety, concern, hopelessness, and depression increase in couples, and they may eventually experience burnout.\n\nIn order to improve the care of infertile individuals, it is clearly stated in the literature that couples need open communication channels with health care professionals, obtaining qualified information, instilling realistic hope, empowerment, accessibility of care services, and they have unmet and high-quality care needs. The increase in the use and use of web-based education services in the globalizing world gives us hope in providing a solution to this issue.\n\nThis project was mainly designed to answer the question of \"Is the responsive web-based roadmap (InT-mAp) developed in solving the problems encountered in drug administration, treatment success and reducing anxiety in infertile women treated with Assisted Reproductive Techniques (ART)?\"\n\nWith InT-mAp, which investigators will develop using web-based education technology, which is a distance education method in this age of technology; investigators aimed to reduce/reduce the margin of error in ART treatment-drug practices, to contribute positively to the treatment process, and to reduce the social, economic and psychological burdens by reducing the anxiety level of individuals in this process. Besides, the InT-mAp, which will be developed to meet individuals' education and counseling needs for general infertility issues and the treatment process, will reduce the workload of healthcare professionals working in this field and make a positive contribution to drug administration consultancy.\n\nWith this study, investigators aimed to provide participants with time-saving, individualized care, to reach the right information whenever they want, regardless of time and place, on every subject they need in the field of infertility. Investigators predict that sufficient follicle development, healthy oocytes and pregnancy can be achieved by creating awareness in infertile women and minimizing the conditions that may adversely affect the treatment process and results. Contributing to the health and economic indicators of the country by reducing cycle cancellations and reducing costs are among our important goals. The most important features that make the project unique are the absence of online support and a sensitive web-based training platform, where the infertility treatment process in Turkey can be followed in detail by the users, and individualized care and training needs are met."

It is well established that suicidal ideation fluctuates over time. Safety plans in paper format are mandatory part of the treatment regime in the suicide preventive clinics in Denmark. The aim of the trial is to compare the paper version of the safety plan with a new-developed app in reducing suicide ideation and other symptoms, as an add-on to the supportive psychotherapy delivered in the clinics.\n\nHypothesis: It is hypothesized that participants randomized to MYPLAN will have lower suicide ideation as well as improvements on the secondary outcomes than users who have the paper version.\n\nMethods: The trial is designed as a 2-arm observer-blinded parallel group randomized clinical superiority trial, where participants will either receive: 1) Experimental intervention: the safety plan provided as the app MYPLAN, or 2) Treatment as Usual: the safety plan in the original paper format. Both intervention groups will also receive standard psychosocial therapeutic care, up to 8-10 sessions of supportive psychotherapy.Based on a power calculation a total of 546 participants, 273 in each arm will be included. They will be recruited from national suicide preventive clinics. Follow-ups will be conducted at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months after date of inclusion.\n\nParticipants, inclusion and exclusion criteria: There is no age restriction on participation in the study and all participants will be recruited from the suicide prevention clinics in Denmark. These clinics are highly specialized outpatient care centers, offering short-term supportive psychotherapy and social counselling for suicidal patients. In order to participate in the study, participants must have a smartphone (IPhone or android phone) and understand sufficient Danish to use MYPLAN. Persons having a particularly severe alcohol or substance abuse disorder, which might inflict with skills of orientation and memorywill not be offered participation in the RCT.\n\nOutcomes Patient reported outcomes (PROM) are collected at baseline and follow-up through self-administered tablet/internet-based questionnaires. Primary outcome is suicide ideation. Secondary outcomes are:, hopelessness, depressive symptoms, quality of life, and modified CSQ-8.\n\nStatistical analysis: Data analysis will be based on intention-to-treat principle. We will examine this using repeated measurement in mixed models. Missing data will be handled with multiple imputations.\n\nThe trial will start in November 2016 and patient recruitment is expected to finish November 2017.

            "Over 3 million teenagers in the USA have depression, and rates of depression and suicide are sharply increasing. Teenage depression has far-reaching consequences including impairments in academic and work performance and social and family relationships, substance abuse, and worsening of other health conditions, which can persist into adulthood. Access to mental health care for teenagers is limited due to a shortage of mental health providers and many teenagers and parents are reluctant to take antidepressants. COVID-19 and mandated physical and social distancing is expected to increase rates of teenage depression, and further limit access to traditional methods of care (e.g. psychotherapy). This highlights an urgent need to develop accessible, digital treatments for teenage depression to address the serious mental health impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. This fully virtual study (https://www.limbix.com/spark) will compare the relative safety, effectiveness, and engagement of a mobile application based on cognitive behavioral therapy and behavioral activation (Limbix Spark), focusing on the idea that engaging in behaviors that are rewarding or provide a sense of mastery can be effective in reducing symptoms of depression. Limbix Spark will be compared to a mobile app containing educational material about depression (Psychoeducation)."

DLD is the most common childhood learning disorder with a prevalence of 7.4%(1) and occurs in the absence of a known biomedical condition (e.g., hearing loss, autism, stroke, intellectual disability). DLD affects a person's academic and social function due to difficulty with using and understanding language.(2,3) Approximately half of students with DLD have a deficit in vocabulary that persists through highschool.(4) Once children fall behind in their language and vocabulary development, it is very difficult to catch up generally resulting in a wider gap as they progress through their school years. This deficit can have cascading social, mental health, occupational and financial consequences.(5) There is preliminary evidence that a virtual reality experience such as an immersive virtual field trip (iVFT) was beneficial for facilitating vocabulary and comprehension in general education(6-8) and within targeted populations of students including second language learners(9) and those with learning differences (e.g., autism,(10) attention deficit hyperactivity,(11,12) and dyslexia(13). The term \"immersive\" refers to a state of heightened sensation when viewing a simulated environment that is superimposed onto a screen with embedded multisensory input (e.g., visual, auditory, proprioceptive).(14) The viewer looks through 3D goggles to block out the present environment resulting in a feeling of presence. These simulated experiences or destinations (e.g., space) are a type of VR referred to as an immersive virtual field trip (iVFT).\n\nTo date, there is a lack of empirical evidence, explicitly targeting academic vocabulary growth for early grade school students with DLD. In addition, no study has reported on learning outcomes of students with DLD following a VR condition. Therefore, the primary study objective was to compare gains in academic vocabulary measures between a traditional book condition and an iVFT learning condition for young students with DLD."

            "Approximately 70% of American adults have overweight/obesity, which increases risk of major medical issues and preventable death (Abdelaal et. al, 2017). Many individuals with overweight/obesity attempt to lose weight through behavioral strategies, e.g., adopting a reduced-calorie diet and/or increased physical activity. However, it is exceedingly difficult to consistently adhere to a reduced-calorie diet and high levels of physical activity; as such, most individuals attempting to lose weight via these methods experience repeated instances of non-adherence, i.e., dietary and physical activity lapses. These lapses are a core driver of weight loss failure, undermining individuals' ability to achieve weight control (Forman et al, 2017). As such, it is important to understand what predicts these lapses, which in turn allows for better lapse prevention. The current study proposes to measure these risk factors in an ecologically valid manner, i.e., in the moment they occur and in the context of individuals' everyday lives, using advanced technology. Specifically, the current study will use ecological momentary assessments (EMA; brief, repeated surveys delivered in one's natural environment, typically via a smartphone) and sensor technology (e.g., Fitbit and sensors on smartphone devices) to measure momentary risk factors of dietary and physical activity lapse, as well as the lapses themselves. Findings from this research project will lay the groundwork for a sophisticated just-in-time adaptive intervention (JITAI), a tailored, personalized intervention that targets momentary risk factors (e.g., cravings) via in-the-moment support, thereby reducing lapse occurrence and improving adherence to behavioral weight control prescriptions."

            "Chronic low water intake may raise the risk of morbidity and mortality by influencing key water regulating hormones (e.g., AVP), which are known to modulate glucoregulation and renal function. For example, AVP stimulates the HPA axis to release the glucocorticoid stress hormone cortisol with potentially far-reaching effects on metabolism, immunity and inflammation. One study observed elevated blood cortisol in a group of low water drinkers, albeit cortisol was measured at one time of day only. However, in the field of psychobiology, researchers have traditionally related more dynamic assessments of cortisol with health outcomes; by evoking cortisol responses to acute standardised laboratory stressors, such as The Trier social stress test. More recently, researchers have appreciated the importance of circadian variability in cortisol levels, by examining influences on, and consequences of individual differences in the diurnal variation of cortisol. The major measurable parameters of the diurnal variation are; the cortisol awakening response (CAR), which is the rise in cortisol during the first 30-45 minutes following awakening, and the diurnal cortisol slope, which is the rate of decline in cortisol levels across the day, from morning to evening. These parameters are considered to reflect different aspects of HPA axis function; with the CAR best reflecting the adrenal capacity to respond to stress and awakening and diurnal slope more indicative of daily cortisol exposure. Although distinct, both blunted CAR and a flattened diurnal cortisol slope appear to be consistent markers of HPA axis dysfunction and related to a variety of poor health outcomes. Therefore, it has been recommended that contemporary research should simultaneously estimate an individual's awakening cortisol responsiveness, and diurnal slope, thereby capturing distinct and important components of HPA axis function. The shared pathways that regulate body water, diurnal variation in cortisol and our response to stress underpin the broad aim of this research programme: to investigate the influence of low and high fluid intake on diurnal cortisol variation and the cortisol response to acute stress.\n\nThe aims of this study are to investigate:\n\n1. The influence of a change in water intake behaviour on diurnal saliva cortisol variation as assessed by the CAR (primary outcome)\n2. The influence of a change in water intake behaviour on biomarkers of hydration and thirst as assessed by urine osmolality, urine colour and thirst sensation.\n3. The influence of habitual low and high total fluid intake on saliva cortisol response to an acute psychological stress (secondary outcome)\n4. Investigate the influence of a change in water intake behaviour on plasma biomarkers of hydration as assessed by plasma osmolality and plasma copeptin (exploratory outcome)"

The lifestyle behaviors of interest included meal regularity, self-monitoring of diet and physical activity, fast-food eating, screen related viewing and eating, dietary modifications, self-weighing, and physical activity. It was hypothesized that increases in meal regularity, self-monitoring, healthy dietary modifications, self-weighing, and physical activity would lead to better weight control over six months. Conversely, it was hypothesized that increases in fast food consumption and screen related eating and viewing would lead to poorer weight control over six months. It was expected that promotion and prevention conditions, relative to the control condition, would lead to better weight control and increases in meal regularity, self-monitoring, healthy dietary modifications, self-weighing, and physical activity, and decreases in fast food consumption and screen related eating and viewing. Furthermore, it was expected that the promotion condition would lead to better outcomes than the prevention condition."

The investigators have developed an online behavioral weight loss program that is effective, low-cost, and highly scalable. However, existing research suggests that tailoring treatment to address 3 well-established weight loss barriers in sexual minority women will be critical for maximizing the relevance and efficacy of behavioral weight loss for this group. In the Preparation Phase of this K23, the investigators developed 3 novel treatment components targeting sexual minority women's weight loss barriers (i.e., minority stress, low social support, and negative body image), the investigators piloted the program among sexual minority women of higher weight, and the investigators conducted individual qualitative interviews to elicit feedback on the intervention's acceptability, cultural relevance, usability, and feasibility, and this feedback was used to refine the program.\n\nIn the Optimization Phase of this K23 (the current phase), 88 women will receive 12 weeks of Rx Weight Loss and will be randomized to receive 0-3 tailored components in a full factorial design with 23 (8) distinct combinations of components. Novel components that increase mean weight loss (by \u22652%) or the proportion of women achieving clinically meaningful weight loss (by \u226510%) at 6 months will be retained in a finalized obesity treatment package that the investigators will evaluate in a future randomized controlled trial (RCT) (Evaluation Phase). The aims of this study are to:\n\nAim 2A (Optimization): Use a factorial experiment to determine how 3 novel components impact mean weight loss and the proportion of women achieving a 5+% weight loss at 6 months.\n\nAim 2B (Mediation): Clarify how tailored components impact weight loss by testing hypothesized mechanisms of action (i.e., coping with stress, perceived social support, weight and shape concerns).\n\nThis project will tailor and optimize an evidence-based online behavioral obesity treatment to enhance weight loss outcomes in sexual minority women."

Women with a history of depression have a 20 fold higher risk of PDA at subsequent pregnancies. The adverse outcomes extend beyond maternal well-being to long-term deficits in children and families. The gut-brain axis is a newly recognized key player in mental health disorders. Specifically, the microbial composition of the gut along with their metabolites are directly involved in disease onset and course. Recent clinical studies have identified diet as the most powerful environmental factor in manipulating gut microbiome. Given vulnerability and resistance of pregnant women to pharmacotherapy, particularly in those with a predisposition to mood disorders, as well as pregnant women's high motivation and commitment to improving gestational diet, a dietary/supplemental intervention to 'optimize' gut microbiome, is a favored approach in disease management. The study investigators aim to exploit microbial responsiveness to diet together with this maternal motivation, to alter the risk and severity of a universal public health concern that has dire and long-term consequences for new moms and their children.\n\nThe investigators of this trial, will first study the challenges in pursuing a study aimed at changing the microbiome of pregnant women with a history of mood disorders. Pregnant women in their second trimester will be recruited. Each will be assigned or randomized to one of four groups that will use a combination of diet, supplementation with probiotics, fish oil or no intervention. Each participant will meet with the study team virtually every 3 months until 1 year after delivery.

This can profoundly affect the ability of active duty (AD) women to advance in their career. The first 12 weeks postpartum are the time period during which the most significant weight loss occurs and is critical in achieving a healthy weight in the first year postpartum. Many factors contribute to effective weight loss in this period among which the most critical are diet, exercise, and sleep. Breast feeding and depression may also affect weight changes postpartum. Research has shown diet to likely be the most crucial of these factors.\n\nThe PADaWL study is designed as a randomized controlled trial to assess the effects of dietary intervention on weight and physical fitness versus routine postpartum care in the first year postpartum. Subjects will be primiparous AD women from any military service recruited in the obstetric clinic in the third trimester of pregnancy at Tripler Army Medical Center. Data will collected in an ambi-directional fashion with pre-pregnancy physical fitness data, demographic and pregnancy data collected at time of enrollment. Subjects will be randomized to receive intensive virtual sessions with a dietician vs routine postpartum care for the first 12 months postpartum. We will utilize a biometric device to monitor activity levels and sleep, web-based diaries to monitor breast feeding and diet, and validated questionnaires to evaluate depression as well as diet and sleep. Subjects will be monitored weekly for the first 12 weeks postpartum and will then be further evaluated at 6, 9 and 12 months postpartum.\n\nPrimary outcome is weight at 12weeks postpartum and whether subjects have achieved military standards. Secondary outcome will be weight at 12 months postpartum and whether subject has achieved weight and fitness standards. The study intends to collect large amounts of data, and we intend to analyze which factors may be contributing to weight retention postpartum.\n\nThis study should provide an accurate assessment of the effects of pregnancy on AD women. It should generate a clean and accurate dataset on which multiple follow-on studies can be performed and provide data for designing further intervention studies in postpartum women. The results of this study should also be able to assist in developing policy and guidance concerning AD women and pregnancy."

            "Multicenter Study Evaluating the Relationship Between Perceived Daily Stress Level and Glycemic Level in Subjects with Type 1 Diabetes",
            "Type 1 diabetes (T1D) affects around 200,000 people in France. The only treatment is insulin, administered either by multiple injections, by pump alone or, more recently, by automated insulin delivery systems (AIDs), which have resulted in a very significant improvement in glycaemic control and quality of life. These closed-loop (CL) devices are capable of effectively regulating the conventional factors associated with glycaemic disturbance, namely dietary intake and physical activity. However, they do not account of stress, which some subjects with T1D perceive as a major disrupter of their blood sugar levels. One of the reasons for this is undoubtedly that stress, unlike diet or physical activity, cannot be anticipated. Since stress is difficult to predict, it is also more difficult to study. Its onset, intensity, duration and progression are linked to the subject's experience, psychological state and environment. Not all patients respond to stress triggers in the same way. Some patients appear to be more reactive than others to these agents, particularly when they are exposed to them chronically or repeatedly, in an anxiety-provoking environment. This is known as chronic psychosocial stress, and it is this type of stress that seems to be most closely associated with glycaemic disturbance in subjects with T1D, most often in the form of hyperglycaemia and, more rarely, hypoglycaemia. However, there are no solid epidemiological or experimental data to support these observations.\n\nThe study we propose is a prospective multicentre clinical trial in 125 subjects with T1D treated with insulin pumps or multi-injections at 14 French university centres. Our aim is to evaluate the relationship between interstitial glucose levels measured by CGM and perceived stress, assessed 4 times a day, away from mealtimes in order to avoid the impact of dietary glycaemia, using a \"stressometer\". This stressometer is an application designed by CERITD that can be downloaded to the patient's smartphone and consists of an electronic visual analogue scale (VAS) on which the level of stress felt is evaluated quantitatively (continuous value between 0 and 10)."

There is an unmet need to identify novel ways to detect, treat and prevent their spread. New wearable devices could address this need, using special biosensors worn by patients.\n\nThis is a single centre, controlled, before and after, longitudinal, clinical trial. Participants will receive FluMist, a live attenuated influenza vaccine, which will act as a proxy to a viral respiratory tract infection and create a very minor response to the immune system. Vital signs and activity levels will be monitored continuously using wearable biosensors for 7 days prior to and 7 days following, along with symptom tracking and blood tests to measure immune responses. Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) algorithms will be used to analyse the data.\n\nAI and ML will identify subtle changes in vital signs and activity levels from the immune response to respiratory viruses. These data will help develop future methods to address important public health questions related to respiratory virus detection, containment and management.\n\nThe purpose of this study is to explore whether wearable sensors can detect, track the progress and recovery from viral respiratory tract infection."

            "Special Operations Forces (SOF) train continually to maintain peak performance. Thus, they are nearly always in a state of recovery, and in need of noninvasive therapies to address the taxing workload. Photobiomodulation therapy (PBMT) is a noninvasive treatment where a low-level laser is applied to the body to enhance healing, recovery, and performance. Army Tactical Human Optimization Rapid Rehabilitation and Reconditioning (THOR3) provides a consistent avenue for implementation of PBMT as a modality. Studies in athletes have shown performance and recovery benefits with pre-and post-workout focal application of PBMT. While there is less evidence on the potential cognitive/behavioral effects of a systematic application of PBMT, self-reported fatigue has also been found to be significantly lower in groups with focal PBMT application as compared to placebo. Further, PBMT research in healthy military tactical athletes is limited. PBMT may be a promising tool for enhancing physical performance by accelerating musculoskeletal and psychological recovery in the SOF population. The investigators aim to study the physiologic and behavioral effects of PBMT application post-exercise on performance in SOF Operators.\n\nThe Intent: The investigators propose to conduct a single-blinded randomized-control trial with sham control to investigate the effectiveness of providing PBMT post physical training in a SOF population.\n\nThe specific aims of this study are to:\n\n1.

            "Mental health disorders are one of the most challenging chronic conditions to identify, treat and manage. This is largely due to the fact that diagnoses are almost entirely based on the patient's recall of current and past subjective experiences of symptoms; and then further interpreted by a healthcare professional introducing multiple layers of information biases in the formulation of a diagnosis. Accordingly, mental health conditions remain prevalent with high rates of misdiagnosis, inappropriate treatment and delayed intervention. In light of the heterogeneity across and within mental health conditions, a personalized interventional approach holds merit, yet the tools to effectively track an individual's day to day objective and subjective experience needed to achieve an individualized care approach have not until recently existed.\n\nDigital technologies such as passive and active sensing from smartphones and from wearable devices are shedding light on the capabilities of tracking new objective measures of health that could translate to key symptoms of mental health conditions. 'Multimodal data' approaches are those that attempt to translate a variety of electrical signals from digital devices to relevant health outcomes. The combination of digital devices to detect multimodal measures of mental health symptoms offers a unique opportunity to take a ground up approach in understanding the fluidity of mental health symptoms occurring at the individual level that might lend insight into new phenotypes of mental health illnesses that could have a physiological underpinning.\n\nThe Study Investigators aim to characterize the multiplexing and fluid nature of mental health symptoms across individuals experiencing mental health symptoms and conditions using digital tools (i.e., wearables and mobile apps) and additional context information collected from virtual study support calls.\n\nThe Investigators hope to know how objective measures from sensor data translate to core symptoms, episodes and flares across mental health disorders, and develop new (or new applications of) machine learning anomaly detection approaches and determine whether anomalies in expected symptom portraits can be reliably detected and enhanced by the addition of objectively measured data."

Despite the technological progress, the detection of neoplastic changes in the lymph nodes is of low effectiveness, which results from the imperfection of the criteria used. Currently, the most widely used criterion is the RECIST 1.1 guideline developed in the 1990s, according to which the lymph node dimension in the short axis with a cut-off point of 10 mm is decisive. Lymph nodes smaller than 10 mm across are considered normal. It is a criterion with a high error rate, both due to the false-negative diagnoses (with small metastases below 10 mm) and false-positive diagnoses (in the case of inflammatory lymphadenopathy).\n\nA particular disadvantageous situation is when the metastatic nodes and their transverse dimension is less than 10 mm, because they are treated as healthy nodes and the degree of the disease advancement is underestimated. As a result, the patient is not treated properly - no complete lymphadenectomy, no radiotherapy to the area of these nodes or insufficient systemic treatment. In all cases, underestimating the stage of the neoplastic diseases increases the risk of the recurrence.\n\nLN-RADS accounts small metastases in nodes about 3 mm in size, thus about 20% more metastatic nodes may be detected compared to RECIST 1.1 method. This means that currently, according to RECIST 1.1 rules, approx. 20% of patients have missed nodal metastases and consequently receive insufficient treatment resulting in relapse. Previous studies have shown that RECIST 1.1 shows a high level of underestimation of metastatic nodes. The Node-RADS system, as the second comparator next to RECIT 1.1, is a fairly new system moving towards the structural assessment of lymph nodes, but proposed arbitrarily, without hard evidence for its effectiveness. Despite the publication of the Node-RADS system in a medical journal, it is not validated. The Node-RADS has numerous limitations and weaknesses that reduce its value."

The treatment being tested in the present study is a noninvasive, personalized form of brain stimulation, called transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS).\n\nThe investigators intend to answer the questions:\n\n1. Does personalized TMS improve brain connectivity after concussion?\n2. Does personalized TMS improve avoidance behaviors and chronic concussive symptoms?\n3. Do the improvements last up to 2 months post-treatment?\n4. Are there predictors of treatment response, or who might respond the best?\n\nParticipants will undergo 14 total visits to University of California Los Angeles (UCLA):\n\n1.

            "Ectopic fat is the accumulation of adipose tissue in anatomical sites not classically associated with fat storage - for example, in the liver and skeletal muscles. Excessive fat accumulation in liver cells, often diagnosed as non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), is a precursor to a wide range of liver conditions and metabolic disorders. The usual standard of care for NAFLD is to advise weight loss through controlled diet and physical activity, but the outcome of weight management and treatment of NAFLD is highly variable.\n\nDiet interventions - such as the Mediterranean, ketogenic, paleo, and high-protein-low-carbohydrate diets - have shown varied benefits in the management of NAFLD. However, food-based interventions must align with cultural and regional preferences in food to succeed in making the modifications part of the habitual diet. A recent diet intervention study (Della Pepa et al., 2020) highlighted that the components of a diet, rather than its caloric content, play a greater role in achieving healthier outcomes. In this study, a multifactorial diet intervention using locally sourced and produced meals will be implemented with the aim of reducing elevated liver fat content in healthy women diagnosed with NAFLD.\n\nThe study will also evaluate the effects of the proposed diet on the participants' metabolic health and describe potential changes in their gut microbiome signatures (via frequent stool samples). The dysregulation of the gut microbiota has been linked to the development of NAFLD and it is known that the composition of the gut microbiota could be modified by dietary intake. This study will investigate the association of gut microbiome signatures with elevated liver fat in Asian women and test whether the dietary intervention will modify their gut microbiota.\n\nFinally, ectopic fat in the liver is a highly prevalent condition worldwide but the cut-off values for NAFLD has been largely derived from studies performed in Western populations. This study seeks to cross examine the diagnostic ranges in various clinical assessments of NAFLD that commonly involve ultrasound spectroscopy (Fibroscan), fatty liver indexes (FLI) and magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS). This effort seeks to derive appropriate cut-off values for NAFLD in Singaporean-Chinese women."

These sense organs include the inner ear (the vestibular system), the eyes (the visual system), the sense of where one's legs, back, and neck are (proprioceptive system), and one's higher thinking (cognitive centers). If spatial disorientation is severe or occurs in motion-na\u00efve individuals, spatial disorientation can lead to motion sickness.\n\nThe Sparrow Ascent System\u2122 is a wearable, battery-operated transcutaneous auricular (ear) neurostimulation (tAN) device. This means that it uses electrical pulses to stimulate branches of nerves on and/or around the ear, specifically the \"vagus\" and \"trigeminal\" nerves. These nerves are also responsible for your sensation of nausea and your heart rate (vagus nerve), as well as headaches (trigeminal nerve). The Sparrow System utilizes a flexible earpiece with embedded hydrogel electrodes that stick to the skin, the earpiece is disposable after use. This device is already Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved for use in humans and is safely used for control of symptoms in a variety of other medical conditions, such as opioid withdrawal and acute stress reaction. In this study, we will determine if the Sparrow Ascent System\u2122 impacts the development of spatial disorientation or motion sickness."

Furthermore, according to the American College of Rheumatology, such a generalised non-joint pain state occurs for at least three months in duration, predominantly in women over 50 years of age.

Plus, they have additional sex-specific cardiovascular risk factors such as gestational hypertension/diabetes, preterm delivery, premature menopause, and polycystic ovary syndrome.\n\nCardiovascular rehabilitation (CR) is a Class I, level A, clinical practice guideline recommendation, multidisciplinary secondary prevention program that has been shown to reduce cardiovascular mortality, rehospitalization, and improve quality of life. Despite all established benefits, CR continues to be under referred to women compared to men, with lower enrolment rates and lower adherence to exercise sessions. The reasons for the underuse of CR by women and the main barriers have been widely studied. Thus, sex-specific implementation strategies have been developed to improve adherence, however, the efficacy claims of these interventions are equivocal, as some studies revealed no significative difference regarding adherence between different exercise delivery modes and mixed-sex programs, whereas others revealed greater preference towards women-only programs.\n\nFew randomized controlled trials (RCT) examined the efficacy of CR programs tailored to women in adherence, enrolment, functional capacity, physical activity, body composition, and quality of life.

The investigators will focus on two constructs important to mental health and hypothesize that: A) Anxiety, self-report stress and quality-of-life measures will significantly improve when comparing: A.1) Pre-to-post intervention, and; A.2) Control vs. intervention groups over 8 weeks and at 1-month follow-up. B) Arousal, autonomic indices of HRV (reflecting parasympathetic activation) will significantly improve, when comparing: B.1) Pre-to-post intervention, and; B.2) Control vs. intervention groups over 8 weeks and at 1-month follow-up.\n* Aim 2: Establish the sustainability of two Mindfulness DHP interventions utilizing retention, usage (frequency), and participant satisfaction.\n* Aim 3: Examine associations between COVID-19 related stress, mental health outcomes, and HRV. Examine the extent to which COVID-19 related stress and mental health symptoms are linked to HRV at baseline and how that relationship changes over time.\n\nParticipants will be assigned to 1 of 3 arms of the study: MTIA intervention, MAPP intervention, or wait-list control. All participants will be mailed a device with the SMILE app installed, and the equipment for recording cardiac data in the home. All participants will complete the baseline psychometrics measures and physiological stress test using the instructions provided on the SMILE app. Those assigned to the MTIA or MAPP intervention groups will then participate in their assigned intervention over the subsequent 8 weeks. During these 8 weeks, psychometric and physiological data will be completed biweekly for all participants. 3 months following the initial baseline, all participants will complete a final psychometric/physiological evaluation."

            "The vagus nerve (VN) plays a crucial role in regulating vital functions (heart rate, blood pressure, digestion, and immune response) and maintaining communication between internal organs and the brain. Recent studies have highlighted the therapeutic potential of VN stimulation (VNS) in treating various conditions such as drug-resistant epilepsy, postural control deficit, COVID-19 infection, chronic pain, and intestinal disorders. In addition, there is growing evidence that the molecules released by the VN neurons affect the function of the gut microbiota and that the molecules released by the bacteria in our gut affect the activity of the VN neurons. In particular, Dr. Giacomo Carta (the leader of this study) has shown how painless neck movements, i.e. mechanical VNS (mVNS), can be applied without adverse effects, representing a potential alternative to invasive methods commonly used today. To further investigate the impact of this novel mVNS, this study aims to evaluate the changes induced by three mVNS protocols on physiological parameters such as resting heart rate, and Heart Rate Variability (HRV) at rest, balance in standing, the perceived intensity of mechanical stimuli using the established clinical method of QST (quantitative sensory testing), fecal transit speed, and the molecular composition of stool (for this, stool samples are analyzed). In particular, stool analysis is very relevant for understanding normal digestion. The present research aims to define the optimal intensity of mVNS and to investigate the therapeutic potential of VNS in the treatment of autonomic dysfunction (such as too low or too high heart rate, too low or too fast digestion, throbbing headaches), as well as falls prevention and pain."

One of the studied practices to aid in rehabilitation is meditation, believed to alter physiological aspects related to stress such as respiratory rate, oxygen consumption, carbon dioxide production, and systolic blood pressure, suggesting a better sympathetic-vagal balance. Objective: To assess the effects of Zazen meditation practice on heart rate variability in patients with recent acute and chronic myocardial infarction. Methodology: Randomized Clinical Trial. Chronic assessments will include: HRV with Polar H10 heart rate monitor, Quality of Life assessment with SF36 Quality of Life and Health questionnaire, Spiritual assessment with WHOQOL SR Spirituality, Religiosity, and Personal Beliefs questionnaire, Biochemical Parameters with ultra-sensitive PCR and cortisol, Ventricular Ejection Fraction (VEF), and 6-minute Walk Test (6MWT). Acute assessments will include: HRV with Polar H10 heart rate monitor, before and after a meditation session, in time and frequency domains. Sample size calculation was performed using Winpepi software version 11.43, with a power of 80% and significance level of 5%, determining a sample of 44 individuals. For intra-group differences analysis, ANOVA for repeated measures and/or its non-parametric counterpart, Friedman Test, will be used. For proportion analysis and comparison, Chi-square Test will be used. Expected Results: It is expected that the findings will contribute to a better understanding of the potential benefits that a meditation intervention may bring to patients who have experienced acute myocardial infarction."

Although it severely affects their quality of life, stress intolerance remains a mystery. Hence, unravelling the mechanisms underlying stress intolerance is crucial to understand CWP pathophysiology and to develop novel treatments. Epigenetic mechanisms hold the potential to provide an answer as they have been found to be altered in patients with CWP at baseline, and in response to stress. However, research on epigenetic mechanisms in CWP is very scarce. Hence, this study aims to address this knowledge gap by assessing stress-induced epigenetic changes in patients with CWP and healthy controls aiming to unravel whether epigenetic mechanisms can help explain stress intolerance. The regulatory role of epigenetic mechanisms will be researched in relation to the activity of enzymes affected by the epigenetic mechanisms, neurophysiological measures, and stress-induced symptom changes in patients with CWP."

            "Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death worldwide, with ischemic heart disease (IHD) the leading cause of cardiovascular mortality. Persons with IHD suffering from psychological distress, including hopelessness, are more likely to die from IHD. Following a stressful event, the vagus nerve enables activation of either a sympathetic (fight/flight) or parasympathetic (rest/digest) response. Heart rate variability (HRV), the beat-to-beat variability between normal successive heart beats, is a biomarker of both adaptive and maladaptive reactions to stress. Decreased HRV predicts greater risk for morbidity and mortality and is associated with poor mental health outcomes in persons with IHD. As stated by polyvagal theory, HRV may be influenced by social support. Decreased perceived social support (PSS), a social determinant of cardiovascular risk, is predictive of increased morbidity and mortality in persons with IHD. Decreased PSS has been associated with hopelessness in patients with cancer, but this relationship has not been studied in IHD beyond the applicant's small pilot study of patients with hopelessness. Hopelessness, a negative outlook and sense of helplessness about the future, is present in 27-52% of patients with IHD. This is of grave concern, because hopelessness is associated with a 3.4 times increased risk of mortality and nonfatal myocardial infarction in patients with IHD, independent of depression. This research focuses on understanding the biological (HRV) and social (PSS) aspects of hopelessness, with the long-term goal of developing and testing novel interventions to reduce the adverse effects of hopelessness and improve health outcomes in patients with IHD. Participants for this cross-sectional study will be recruited while hospitalized for an IHD event. Participants will include patients who report moderate to severe hopelessness from the sponsor's NIH-funded study (n = 225); additional patients with minimal to no hopelessness will be recruited and enrolled by the applicant (n = 45). Data collection will take place remotely two weeks after hospital discharge. Specific aims include: Aim 1) Evaluate the relationship between HRV and hopelessness in patients with IHD; Aim 2) Determine the relationship between PSS and hopelessness in patients with IHD; and Aim 3) Explore the possible mediating effect of HRV on the relationship between PSS and hopelessness in patients with IHD."

            "Exercising in a nature setting has been credited with benefits for health and well-being, more so than exercising indoors. Additionally, motoric performance in the same exercise (e.g., running speed, more strenuous physical activity) has been reported in some studies to be greater if practiced outdoors, in a nature setting. The explanation may be in the inherent variability of natural landscapes, the textures, elevations, obstacles and objects which are not found in standard built and indoor settings. Indoor settings are characterized by safe, organized, patterned textures and objects created for specific ends, which inhibit variability in physical and physiological behavior. Variability in the environment turns into variability in body systems, which benefits health, well-being, and skill acquisition.\n\nVariability in behavior depends also on the task. Running or walking is essentially a journey throughout the environment in which interaction with obstacles, puddles, and other runners is part of the variability of the activity. On the other hand, physical activity such as HICT is done in a small area, and is a scripted, prescribed activity (e.g., push-ups, sit-ups), which lowers the amount of variability in behavior. The aim of this trial is to test if a low variability activity shows differences in performance, wellbeing, and behavior measures according to the amount of variability in the environment.\n\nIn this trial the participants will engage in two high intensity circuit training (HICT) interventions - one in an indoor setting, and another in a nature setting. The HICT intervention includes 12 calisthenic exercises, and will be performed at a self-selected intensity by the participants. Each exercise will be performed during one minute, followed by 30 seconds of rest where the participants will be instructed what the next exercise will be. Before exercising, the participants put a heart rate monitor and two inertial measurement units (IMUs) on the right arm and leg, according to the correct usage guidelines, and rate their positive affect, arousal, and perceived exertion. Immediately after exercising, they rate the same measures again.\n\nResearch Hypotheses:\n\nGreater movement variability, heart rate variability, performance, wellbeing, and arousal during HICT in nature setting than indoor setting."

Basically, invasive (iVSS) and transcutaneous VSS (tVSS) can be performed. tVSS is more preferred because of its advantages such as easy application, not requiring surgical procedure and having fewer side effects. VSS has long been an approved treatment modality in the treatment of epilepsy and refractory depression. tVSS can be administered from the auricular-auricular or posterior ear region. The vagus nerve (VS) belongs to the parasympathetic branch of the autonomic nervous system and has an effect on vital functions. There are also studies in the literature showing that VS stimulation reduces inflammation. In addition to this effect, the vagus nerve may also show analgesic activity through pain-related pathways. Due to its anti-inflammatory and analgesic effects, VSS has become a new treatment method in diseases in which various inflammatory processes are shown in the etiology such as inflammatory bowel diseases, musculoskeletal system diseases and central nervous system diseases."

            "Temporomandibular joint dysfunction (TMD) is a broad clinical picture involving the TMJ and its disc, masticatory musculature, ligament tissue, and autonomic nervous system (ANS). TMD symptoms include decrease or excessive increase in joint range of motion (ROM), clicking sound or crepitation in the joint, pain around the joint or muscle group, chewing and swallowing problems. Pain caused by MPS, trigger point, fatigue, limitation of ROM, and ANS dysfunction cause TMD. With the inclusion of habits such as clenching and bruxism, pain, spasm and disability develop in the chewing muscles. Exposure to repeated trauma and excessive use of chewing muscles may cause the formation of tight bands and trigger points, which are characterized by MPS. When the relationship between TMD and ANS was examined, it was observed that increased sympathetic activity and decreased parasympathetic activity were effective in the severity of TMD symptoms. Auricular vagus nerve stimulation is a peripheral, non-pharmacological and non-invasive neuromodulation technique that modifies signal processing in the CNS, activates reflex circuits, exploits brain plasticity for different therapeutic purposes, thereby affecting very different areas of the brain. Non-invasive or transcutaneous Vagus Nerve Stimulation delivery systems provide stimulation in the auricular branch of the vagus nerve in the outer ear, thus eliminating the need for surgical implantation. The aim of our study is to reveal the extent to which Auricular Vagus Nerve Stimulation, applied in addition to the conventional rehabilitation program, affects the results of the treatment by stimulating the parasympathetic nervous system in patients with Temporomandibular Joint Dysfunction caused by Myofascial Pain Syndrome."

            "Alzheimer's Disease (AD) and Alzheimer's Disease-Related Dementias (ADRD) not only exact a heavy toll on patients, they also impose an enormous emotional, physical, and financial burden on unpaid, often family, caregivers. The strain of providing care for a loved one diagnosed with AD, often across several years, is associated with elevated depression risk and poorer overall health. Emotion regulation skills represent an ideal target for psychological intervention to promote healthy coping in ADRD caregivers. The project seeks to use an experimental medicine approach to test the efficacy and biobehavioral mechanisms of a novel, relatively brief, targeted, scalable, smartphone-based cognitive emotion regulation intervention aimed at improving psychological outcomes (i.e., reducing perceived stress, caregiver burden, and depressive symptoms) in ADRD unpaid primary caregivers as well as examine potential benefits of the caregiver intervention on quality of life in care recipients. Cognitive reappraisal is the ability to modify the trajectory of an emotional response by thinking about and appraising emotional information in an alternative, more adaptive way. Reappraisal can be operationalized via two primary tactics: psychological distancing (i.e. appraising an emotional stimulus as an objective, impartial observer) and reinterpretation (i.e., imagining a better outcome than what initially seemed apparent). The project will investigate the efficacy and underlying biobehavioral mechanisms of a novel, one-week cognitive reappraisal intervention in this population, with follow-up assessments at 2 weeks, 4 weeks, and 3 months. ADRD unpaid primary caregivers will be randomly assigned to receive training in either distancing, reinterpretation, or a no regulation natural history control condition, with ecological momentary assessments of self-reported positive and negative affect, remotely- collected psychophysiological health-related biomarkers (i.e., heart rate variability data) using pre-mailed Polar H10 chest bands, and health-related questionnaire reports. Distancing training is expected to result in longitudinal reductions in self-reported negative affect, longitudinal increases in positive affect, and longitudinal increases in HRV that are larger than those attributable to reinterpretation training and no-regulation control training."

The gut microbiome plays an important role in overall health and has been shown to dynamically change in response to early-stage triple-negative breast cancer-directed therapies, which in turn has been associated with worse outcomes. As the gut microbiome can be further modulated with dietary changes during cancer treatment, it is an ideal potential modifiable risk factor in cancer patients. However, due to multiple confounding factors such as dietary intake, mood, and activity, its utility as part of the oncologic clinical assessment remains unclear.\n\nIn this prospective randomized controlled study, the investigators propose to recruit up to 30 early-stage TNBC patients to randomize to a personalized nutritional intervention of a high-fiber diet coached by a registered dietician versus educational handout alone during neoadjuvant treatment. The investigators propose to study the gut microbiota through stool sample analysis among early-stage triple-negative breast cancer patients undergoing neoadjuvant (i.e. before surgery) chemotherapy +/- immunotherapy. The investigators will also study how the gut microbiota can be further modulated with a high-fiber diet, and the investigators hypothesize that a high-fiber diet may play a protective role in preserving gut microbial diversity. As part of the nutritional intervention, the investigators propose to administer nutritional counseling with a registered dietitian (RD) to increase fiber intake and tracking performance status, activity, and mood during neoadjuvant treatment. Finally, the investigators propose to survey participants after study completion through one-on-one interviews to determine whether participants experienced improved overall patient satisfaction in supportive care during their treatment."

Coaches require effective and objective load monitoring tools that allow them to make decisions about training plans based on the needs of each player.\n\nMicrosampling systems emerge as an alternative to venipuncture by facilitating self-sampling, which can be carried out outside healthcare centres, in a comfortable and precise way from a small finger prick that the user can perform. These systems are less expensive and can be effective in measuring the levels of glucose metabolism products, such as lactate, through the application of metabolomics and proteomics. On the other hand, the use of non-invasive methods of measuring lactate levels is becoming increasingly popular in sports medicine. The use of saliva as an alternative fluid to the blood shows promise for identifying the concentrations of metabolites that occur during and after sports training."

            "The Heart of the Community Study",
            "Community service providers (CSPs), such as promotores and other community health staff, play an essential role in preserving health and treating disease in underserved Hispanic/Latinx (HL) communities with disproportionately high rates of cardiometabolic (CM) disease. Although effective programs have been developed that deploy CSPs to reduce CM disease risk in the community, to our knowledge no interventions have sought to reduce CM risk among CSPs themselves. However, CSPs are also at high risk for adverse CM outcomes, as they have the same high-risk demographics as the communities they serve and they work in high-stress, frontline jobs. Reducing CM risk among HL CSPs is crucial to promote health at both the individual and community levels; that is, preventive interventions delivered to CSPs may not only promote the health of the individual CSPs who receive the intervention but also may bolster CSPs to more effectively deliver programming that protects CM health community-wide. The proposed study employs relational savoring (RS), a brief intervention rooted in positive psychology and attachment, which has previously been shown to promote psychosocial well-being and which is particularly efficacious in HL populations. Emerging research supports that RS may also promote more optimal cardiovascular regulation and health behavior. Therefore, the investigators deliver RS to CSPs in order to identify CM health protective effects for both CSPs and the high-risk communities they serve.\n\nAims and Hypotheses:\n\nAim 1: Examine effects of RS on CSPs' CM risk factors and outcomes. Hypotheses: RS (compared to wait-list control) will be associated with lower CM risk, as indexed by higher mean HRV, both during a stressor and at rest (H1A). RS will also be associated with a more favorable CM health behavior profile, indexed by higher quality sleep, more exercise, and healthier diet (H1B). Aim 2: Examine effects of RS on CSPs' delivery of CM health programming to the community. Hypotheses: RS will be associated both with reduced threats to CSPs leaving the workforce, including higher satisfaction with work, greater agency, and lower burnout (H2A), and with a higher number of community members reached for CM health programming, as indexed by number of days CSP worked, number of health-related events offered by CSPs, community attendance at events, and retention of community members across multi-day programs (H2B)."

Moreover, there is lack of the studies identifying people who do not respond to stimuli, as well as examining potential determinants of non-responsiveness. Thirdly, there are no studies examining the modification of exercise dose that should be reflected in the response in such individuals.\n\nAim of this human experiment is to examine the effects of one cycle of 8-weeks high-intensity interval training (HIIT) implemented in physical education lesson on: (1) body composition (proportions of the body fat to the body muscles), (2) resting blood pressure, (3) physical efficiency.\n\nStudy are conducted for two years (two cycles). Each year 300 students of two secondary schools, are involved in project: 15-16-year-olds in first year, 18-19-year-olds in second year. Students are divided in experimental groups -performing 8-weeks (twice a week) cycle of HIIT implemented into PE lesson, and the control groups - students following a typical PE programme. Each cycle consists of two parts. First part is related to the 8 weeks of HIIT training, while second part is related to the dose-expose study.\n\nAll participants are examined during project before (Pre), after (Post) and Follow-Up intervention. Second part is planned after a break of several months. Persons who do not respond to the exercise stimulus in the first part will follow individually modified programmes. They will be measured before and after this additional training.\n\nTo examine the assumed HIIT-induced changes in participants the investigators will apply: (1) anthropometric measurements: body height and weight, and BMI will be calculated, (2) body mass composition (fat and muscle mass), (3) resting blood pressure, (4) beep test which is field motor specific test to assess physical efficiency.\n\nThe results of this project will help to answer the fundamental questions about HIIT induced morphological and physiological effects in adolescents, what is important from scientific and public health point of view. Particularly, in view of the growing pandemic of obesity, common elevated blood pressure and steadily declining physical fitness in children and adolescents."

People with severe depression may develop serious psychotic symptoms (e.g., delusions) and have higher mortality and disability than those with mild and moderate depression.\n\nTraditional moderate-intensity continuous training (MICT) (e.g., Baduanjin Qigong) has proved to be effective in preventing and alleviating depressive symptoms among older adults. However, older adults with mental illnesses have poorer engagement and compliance with MICT programs. In recent years, as a novel type of exercise, high-intensity interval training (HIIT), which includes repeated bouts of high-intensity effort followed by varied recovery times, appears to be a promising approach for overcoming limitations in traditional MICT programs.\n\nConsidering there is little evidence of HIIT benefits related to older adults with depression, the current study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of a 16-week HIIT intervention on depressive symptoms and other health-related outcomes among Hong Kong Chinese older adults."

            "While the association of physical and/or motor and/or cognitive components with training can generate synergistic effects and thus create an efficient cognitive enrichment program, very few studies have focused on finding an optimal combined program for older adults. According to the model of Herold and his colleagues, there are two modalities of simultaneous combined training: Thinking While Moving (TwM), when the additional cognitive task is not linked to the motor task, and Moving While Thinking (MwT), when the cognitive task is integrated into the motor task. They assume the latter approach is the most promising for improving cognitive reserve. Nevertheless, to the investigators' knowledge, only one study has compared these two modalities in older adults and none has broadened the question by comparing several MwT trainings.\n\nThe goal of this interventional study will be to compare the cognitive, dual-task, and physical effects of 6 physical and/or cognitive programs in healthy but inactive older adults. The main questions it will aims to answer are:\n\n* Will the Moving While Thinking and Thinking While Moving programs have the same effects?\n* If they have different effects, which will be the best way to improve cognitive, dual-task, and physical functions? The study is being set up between 2023 and 2025 to compare the cognitive, dual- ask and physical effects of 6 programs (3 months, 2 sessions of 1 hour per week). Three experimental MwT programs will be studied: Immersive and interactive wall exergames (I2WE), Complex Cognitive and Motor Activities (2CMA), and exergames with Switch (EXER). They will be compared to an experimental TwM program of stationary bike simultaneous to the Switch (Video games + bike) and 2 control programs: inactive video games (VG) and stationary bike (BIKE). A control group (CON) will be also created.\n\nCognitive, dual-task, and physical pre-tests (before the program), post-tests (after the program), and retention tests (3 months after the end of the program) will be realized to evaluate the effects of the programs."

Therefore, the overarching aim of the study is to understand the optimal order of two types of concurrent training program for 13 weeks by comparing the effectiveness of the training on body composition, predicated maximal oxygen uptake (MaxVO2), dynamic respiratory parameters, and muscle strength in healthy middle-aged people. Methods:Thirty-three moderately-active middle-aged and healthy participants were randomly assigned to the strength+aerobic group (SAG, n = 16) and aerobic+strength group (ASG, n = 17). Body composition, aerobic endurance, respiratory parameters and upper and lower strength were assessed before (pre-test) and after (post-test) a 13-week intervention. The chi-square test and the independent t-test will be used to compare sociodemographic variables between the groups. A 2 x 2 analysis of variance (ANOVA) with repeated measures (group x measurement) will be conducted.\n\nThis study will enhance our understanding of the concurrent training effect on muscle composition and strength.

As a consequence, overweight and obesity at an early age is already considered a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO), with a high incidence in developed countries.\n\nThe abuse of new technologies has remained at worrying levels in the post-COVID period, favoring an increase in the adolescent population considered sedentary. In this regard, up to 70% of adolescents show sedentary behaviors, especially affecting the time spent on screens by both males (93.8%) and females (87.2%). Thus, the use of the cell phone has been shown to be a determining factor, since between 10% and 16% of adolescents show a problematic use of this device, affecting, among other aspects, their behavior during their free time.\n\nIn recent years there has been an increase in sedentary time among adolescents and a decrease in the practice of physical activity that has favored a greater accumulation of body fat and increased the probability of being overweight or obese. In this context, some studies have tried to encourage the practice of physical activity in the school context in overweight and obese population, being these interventions effective to improve body composition.\n\nHowever, these interventions also have their detractors, who argue that the hours of Physical Education are too limited to dedicate so much time to a single content, and that the pedagogical component is often overlooked in their implementation. As an alternative to the above, it has been suggested that Physical Education classes could be used to promote interventions that encourage adolescents to practice physical activity in their free time, and mobile applications could be used to monitor the activity carried out by adolescents, but also as an element that generates adherence and enjoyment in this population. Research in this population using these technologies is scarce, therefore, this project aims to determine the effectiveness of a ten-week intervention promoted from the subject of physical education in which a mobile application is used after school hours on physical activity, body composition and fitness in overweight or obese adolescents."

Additionally, chronic inflammation and its relationship with multiple disease states including cancer, diabetes, heart disease, and all autoimmune conditions effects about 125 million 125 million Americans and is the cause of about 60% of deaths worldwide2. The autonomic nervous system (ANS) acts as a delicate balancing act between sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems, SNS and PSNS respectively. In situations of chronic inflammation and/or chronic stress there is dysregulation of the ANS and subsequent determents to immune function. High intensity interval training (HIIT) has shown as a validated method of improving immune function and specifically natural killer cell (NKC) quantity, function, and cytotoxicity in previously sedentary individuals. NKC mobilization into the vasculature is influenced by activation of the sympathetic nervous system (SNS) and elicit \u03b2-adrenergic-mediated improvements in immune function. Yet HIIT is not appropriate for all individuals, a breathing practice known as cyclic hyperventilation with retention (CHR) mimics the influences of the ANS observed with HIIT training and may elicit the same improvements of immune function.

By focusing on personalized care and lifestyle changes, the study seeks to reduce the chances of another stroke and promote better long-term health.\n\nBackground While strokes are often associated with older adults, recent studies have shown an increase in ischemic strokes among younger individuals. Given that younger patients are typically in their working years and have longer life expectancies, a stroke can lead to significant long-term disability and economic challenges. Addressing the unique needs of this population is crucial for effective care and research.\n\nStudy Design\n\nThis is an open-label pilot study, meaning both participants and researchers know which treatments are being administered. The study will enroll 36 participants who will be randomly assigned in a 2:1 ratio:\n\nIntervention Group (24 participants): Will receive personalized care through a dedicated \"Young Stroke Clinic.\" Control Group (12 participants): Will receive standard post-stroke care.\n\nIntervention Details\n\nParticipants in the intervention group will:\n\n* Attend specialized clinic visits focused on young stroke patients.\n* Receive intensive counseling to manage risk factors such as high blood pressure, cholesterol, and lifestyle habits.\n* Be provided with a wearable device (Whoop 4.0) to monitor health metrics like heart rate, sleep patterns, and physical activity.\n\nDuration The study will last for 12 months, with an 8-month enrollment period and a minimum follow-up of 6 months for each participant.\n\nEligibility Criteria\n\nInclusion:\n\n* Ages 18 to 65.\n* Diagnosed with acute ischemic stroke or high-risk TIA.\n* Moderate to low cardiovascular health status.\n* Able to perform daily activities independently or with minimal assistance.\n\nExclusion:\n\n* Pregnancy.\n* Lack of access to a compatible smartphone for device monitoring.\n* Inability to commit to the follow-up schedule.\n\nObjectives\n\n* Primary Objective: Assess the feasibility of the study by evaluating participant eligibility, consent rates, adherence to interventions, and retention rates.\n* Secondary Objectives: Compare health outcomes between the intervention and control groups, including:\n\nImprovement in cardiovascular health scores. Reduction in major cardiovascular events. Enhancements in physical activity, diet, sleep quality, and smoking cessation. Changes in inflammatory markers in the blood.\n\nPotential Benefits While this is a pilot study and may not provide definitive evidence of effectiveness, it aims to develop a tailored secondary prevention strategy for young stroke patients. The personalized approach could lead to better management of risk factors, improved quality of life, and a reduction in recurrent strokes and other cardiovascular events.\n\nParticipation Participants will be required to attend scheduled clinic visits, engage in counseling sessions, and use the provided wearable device consistently. Regular monitoring and feedback will be integral parts of the program.\n\nConfidentiality All personal health information and data collected during the study will be kept confidential and used solely for research purposes.\n\nThis study is conducted by the Neurology Department and Stroke Unit at the IRCCS Mondino Foundation."

Cancer, certain cancer drugs, radiation therapy, cancer-associated lifestyle disturbances, and cancer-independent comorbidities combine to predispose cancer survivors to autonomic dysfunction (AD). Reduced heart rate variability (HRV) has been described in various cancer cohorts. Furthermore, these markers of AD have been implicated in adverse outcomes in oncology patients, including increased mortality, exercise limitation, and fatigue. However, data are largely derived from small studies with methodological limitations, and the contribution of AD to overall morbidity and mortality in cancer survivors is not well understood.\n\nThe objective is to determine the feasibility and agreement of remote evaluation of resting heart rate and HRV using the commercially available WHOOP\u00ae wrist monitor, compared to in-office measurements using AtCor Medical SphygmoCor HRV Software, in a cohort of 40 St. Jude Life Study participants with a history of mantle radiation for management of Hodgkin lymphoma."

However, there is little documented on the relationship between HRV, training load, and performance measures in the Real-World.\n\nWhoop wrist-worn activity trackers have been validated against the gold-standard Electrocardiography (ECG) for HRV and HR measurements. Whoop leverages photoplethysmography (PPG) technology to continuously track (HR, HRV, respiratory rate, energy expenditure) and provides, daily, individual insights, trends, and coaching to improve strain, sleep, and recovery. Research has demonstrated that heart rate variability (HRV) guided training may be more optimal compared to predetermined training for aerobic exercise improvements.\n\nThe purpose of this study is to assess the feasibility of providing personalized training recommendations based on HRV measured by a consumer-grade wearable (Whoop) in a real-world setting to better understand the HRV relationship with performance."

Another common long-term problem after a stroke is post-stroke fatigue, which affects function and quality of life after stroke. There is currently no clearly effective treatment for post-stroke fatigue. We are investigating whether there might be a connection between sleep-related breathing disturbances, and the risk of developing long-term post-stroke fatigue\n\nThe project is being conducted at Blekingesjukhuset Karlskrona, and inpatients with stroke are asked to participate. Participants are equipped with a sleep analysis pad under the mattress that measures breathing patterns during the night, as well as a wrist-worn device that measures oxygen saturation in the blood. Participants are also asked about their functional level in daily life and any symptoms of obstructive sleep apnea. One year after the stroke, participants are invited for a follow-up visit where we ask about post-stroke fatigue, depressive symptoms, and treatment and investigations related to the stroke.\n\nWe will then investigate the relationship between sleep-related breathing disturbances, measured early after stroke, and the risk of significant fatigue after the stroke. This could lead to future studies with treatment trials for obstructive sleep apnea in certain individuals with post-stroke fatigue. The study could also lead to potentially increased awareness that these conditions might be connected, which could result in a higher likelihood of detecting treatable obstructive sleep apnea in certain subgroups after stroke."

            "During and after pregnancy, a woman's body and brain undergo significant changes that help her adapt to caregiving and emotional needs. However, this period also makes women more susceptible to emotional disorders, such as peripartum depression (PPD), which affects about 10-15% of new mothers. PPD can negatively impact both the mother and her baby, disrupting mood, motivation, and mothering abilities. Hormonal changes and poor sleep are some of the risk factors that might worsen these depressive symptoms.\n\nTraditionally, sleep studies on PPD have relied on questionnaires and short-term sleep assessments. With the advent of smartwatches and digital devices, we can now monitor sleep in a home environment over longer periods. Oxytocin, a hormone crucial for childbirth, breastfeeding, and bonding with the baby, is thought to play a role in PPD. Studies suggest that higher levels of oxytocin might be linked to lower levels of postpartum depression, though findings are not always consistent. Oxytocin also affects sleep and is connected to brain areas that regulate reward and motivation.\n\nThis study aims to explore the relationship between sleep, oxytocin, and reward processing in new mothers. The investigators will include women with varying levels of depressive symptoms and use home-based sleep assessments to gather data. Our goal is to better understand how these factors interact in the postpartum period and how they might influence a mother's mental health and caregiving abilities.\n\nThe investigators expect that oxytocin levels are reduced in women with higher depressive symptoms and that these reductions are associated with sleep impairments, breastfeeding and altered reward processing."

In view of the detrimental effects of circadian misalignment, the large group of older people suffering from sleep problems, and the seeming importance of chronoactivity, the investigators will perform a randomised cross-over study that aims to uncover the effect of timing of physical activity on insomnia severity and related(circadian) health parameters in older adults with self-reported sleep problems. Here, the investigators hypothesize that timing of physical activity has a beneficial impact on insomnia symptoms and on circadian rhythms of additional health parameters (e.g., metabolic, psychosocial) in older people. To study this research hypothesis, the investigators will examine the effect of physical activity timing on insomnia severity in older adults with self-reported sleep problems. In addition, the investigators will examine the effect of physical activity timing on exploratory rhythmic parameters of biological clock function, physiology and metabolism, mental health, behavioural factors, and immune and cell signalling functions. For this study, a two-armed randomised cross-over study, Dutch speaking older adults between 60 and 80 years old (male and female) and having sleep problems (insomnia severity index\\>10 points) from the general population in the Netherlands will be selected as participants for this study. Participants will perform one sedentary period and two period of increased physical activity with different daily patterns: 1)active morning; 2) active evening with a duration of 14 days each.
